may split into multiple pts (in vid, say what will be in next pts)
around 1-3 hrs (3 pts, each 1hr long)
    make sure you can do the bare min of all pts before uploading 1st pt

don't go over EVERY pt. just the main pts that are impt for understanding why method works and how code works. in pt2+3, explain why it survives against criticism, and what its weaknesses are

learn some youtube editing

just start and stop obs instead of switching tabs

run code w/o details just to see what it does

methods
    associate them with pts of the code

useful generalizations
    from prev and potential future papers
    how to code generalizations?

Scene 5: (~ 3.5 mins)

<<<<<<<<
(~1m):

When using our equation to predict naps from noses on actual samples of cat people, we find that using nose isn't enough to predict nap enjoyment. We found that Jim has a nose of 1 unit, yet has a Nap Smile of 3.5, while Lauren also has a nose of 1 unit, yet has a Nap Smile of 2.5. What's going on here?
    cat person 1 --> 3.5 (2 + (0.5)*3)
    cat person 2 --> 3 (disruptive pattern; don't let it be obvious)
    (don't show values of ear length, only pics of cat person)

It seems we need more features to make a more accurate prediction. After searching for another pattern, it was found that ear length also helps predict nap enjoyment.
    introduce ear length on its own number line and write words Ear Length Space

Just like with nose tip, we also have an ear length of 1 unit. We can make the unit 1 ear twice as big to get the ear of 2 units, or cut it in half to get an ear with 0.5 units.
    on horizontal number line: shrink it, cutting it in half to get the unit 0.5 nose.

<<<<<
How can we represent a Data Measurement of a cat person in terms of both nose tip and ear length? We'll represent both values using a 2-dimensional coordinate space.

If we rotate our ear length number line by 90 degrees and put it next to our nose tip number line, we get a coordinate plane where we can represent each cat person using both nose tip and ear length as axes.
    rotate

    [ in openshot, gradually zoom in the manim video so it's y-axis is (-2, 3) and x-axis is (-2, 7)]

    Face length and ear length vectors, then points, then fade in data samples w/ 1's in them

(~1m):

Now, how can we add together the Nose Tip Data Measurements with the Ear Length Data Measurements to describe a Cat Person? 

(~30s):
Let's say a cat person named Tom comes in, and we have no idea what his measurements are. We start at the origin point (0,0) in our coordinate plane. After taking the first measurement of his nose tip, we find that it's 1 unit, so we can move right from (0,0) to (1,1). But we need to describe Tom using Ear Length, too. So after we measure his ears, we find they are 1 unit long, and so we move up from (1,0) to (1,1).
    show it growing from tail to head

    no equations

These arrows that formed a path of step-by-step instructions are called Vectors, which exist in all sorts of dimensions, including both number lines and coordinate planes. A Vector is an arrow that's defined by a length, and a direction it points in, including diagonals. So you can place them between two coordinate points, from a tail point to a head point. 
    how much states vector of 2, more / less changes direction

For our context, the purpose of the vectors is to tell us where we go from one coordinate point to another, and by how much. To add vectors together, we just move the tail of one vector to the head of another.
    x + y vector both on same 1D number line, then move y's tail on x's head

(~1m, 30s):

(remove?)
There's an important distinction we have to make here; 

unlike the coordinate points, which are permanently fixed where they are, the vectors can be moved anywhere in coordinate space. 

This right-facing vector of length 1 is the SAME one that's been moved here. But it is not the same as this this vector, or this one, or this one.
    right-facing vector of length 1

    right-facing vector of length 2, or this left-facing vector of length 1, or this length one vector going from (0,0) to (1,1).

[remove ?:]
Because each coordinate point is mapped to a different Data Measurement, the vectors also measure the differences between two Data Measurements.
    show vectors on nose tip line

(remove?)
unlike coordinate points, 

But since the vectors can be moved, it seems like this there's no fixed association between a vector and a Data Measurement. 

(remove?)
But recall that every vector has a length, and a direction.

Let's look at our example with Tom where we added two vectors together

, going from the origin to (1,0), then to (1,1). 

We'll represent our vectors using matrix brackets, whose values describe the head of a vector, with its tail on the origin.
    vectors appear on screen like before

    matrix brackets

When a vector's tail is on the origin, the right-facing vector of length 1 points to the same Data Measurement as coordinate point (1,0). But the Data Measurement at (1,0) is just a partial Data Measurement of the vector we'll get when we add together [1, 0] and [0, 1].
    vector matrices appear on screen.

When you add the vector going up to (0, 1), it's as if you're given an instruction to add the Data Measurement on [0, 1] to the partial Data Measurement on [1, 0] we have so far.
    scale up the vector matrices

(speak fast):
For our examples, when adding vectors, associating a vector's length and direction with a Data Measurement helps us intuitively understand how it composes different Data Measurement features together.

(speak fast):
We've made informal descriptions about vectors, but for the ease of demonstration, they'll will help us understand this topic better. This is often done in math classes that don't focus on rigor, but on high-level understanding.

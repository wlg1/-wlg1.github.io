Conclusion

[play start of wind in the rushes and edit middle to have it end when concl narration ends

wind in rushes starts playing again from where it left off, but gets more 'everywhere at end of time' as it goes on. cat person wakes up, thinks is out of dream. but within bubble, sees matrix models. then bigger cloud encapsulates them all. fades out, and end proof

So far, we've summarized concepts from 3Blue1Brown videos that are relevant for our future videos.

In our future videos, we'll discuss topics such as neural network interpretability using matrix factorization, and editing large language models.

For now, we've figured out how to predict which cat people enjoy naps, so we can put that matter to rest. We have only begun on the long journey of finding out just how neural networks work.

[cat person naps while comm dia is created, fading out until only square is left. music fades out

use the commutative diagram logo as an 'end proof' square, which begins moving as everything else fades, and is the last thing staying.

bottomright, fade in then out: "As above, so below" like in cowboy bebop? ]

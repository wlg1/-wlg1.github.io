SCENE 8:

8.1:
One more thing to note is that we showed that while we can go from Nap back to Nose,
    replay anim and eqn

... we can't go from Nap Space back to a 2D Input Space. This is because there are multiple points in Input Space that can go to the same point in Nap Space. 

Let's take all the points that go into Nap Space and place them back in Input Space. Because Nap Space is just a 1 dimensional line of points, the analogous Nap Space in Input Space is just a line. 
    2D to 1D collapse animation

This means that (1,0) is sent to the point (take orth proj), which is a point in Input Space that's also sent to Nap Space. (0,1) is also crammed in with another point, (orth2). 

All these points in 2D Space are crammed into a 1D Nap Space. When this occurs, the weight matrix is called non-invertible.

<<<<<<<<<<<<
8.2:

Now the row in our weight matrix calculates Nap Smile. If we want to use nose and ear to calculate another value, such as Age, we just add another row in our matrix, which has its own conversion factors, giving us a system of equations.

    W=[nosecat earcat  
       noseRat earRat]

Visually, this just means each Data Measurement in 2D Input Space is sent to a point in Nap Space, and also to a point in Age Space. Then we just rotate Age Space vertically to get a 2D coordinate plane, and add nap and age values into a 2D coordinate value.

    rotate, then add nap and age

We'll go over this in more detail in our later videos, along with more complicated neural networks that don't use the Identity as their activation function.

Conclusion

[play end of wind in the rushes based on how long it takes to say this (ie if 30 secs, play last 30secs)]

We talked about using different sets of dimensions in Latent Space to represent our data. But there's still many questions about Latent Space to answer. In the next video of this series, we'll talk how models are analogies to relative relations between data samples, but that they're not the data samples themselves. To not confuse the map with the territory, we must beware of False Friends in the Matrix.

For now, we've figured out how to predict which cat people enjoy naps, so we can just put that to rest.

use the commutative diagram logo as an 'end proof' square, which begins moving as everything else fades, and is the last thing staying.

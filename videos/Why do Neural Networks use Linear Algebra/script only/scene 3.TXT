Now, we can also measure Nap Smile along Nap Space. Each positive unit measures how big their smile is.

Let's take an example where the longer a cat person's nose tip was, the more they liked naps. A cat person with a nose tip of 1 unit had 2 Nap Smile units, a cat person with 2 nose tip units had 4, and so forth.

We notice a pattern here that's somewhat like unit conversion. For instance, for every 1 meter, there are 3.28 feet. So if an person is 2 meters tall, they're also 6.56 feet tall.

So let's convert nose units into nap units. Turning this into an equation, we have 2 * (nose) = 2 nap.

And visually speaking, this means that for every one unit of nose tip, there are two units of Nap Smile. 

Notice the point 1 in the Nose number line and the point 2 in the Nap number line are labeling the same Nose Tip Measurement. This is because we're saying that every nose tip of 1 ALWAYS has a nap smile of 2. 

Our equation isn't mapping a number, such as 1, to another number, such as 2, but it is mapping a Data Measurement from 1 in the nose space to 2 in the nap space. This is a Change of Units.

Likewise, for every two units of nose tip, there are four units of Nap Smile.

Our unit conversation factor of 2 can be represented, in general, as a variable W, which means how much we should weigh our nose value by to get our nap value.

(move to end? state will discuss more on equivalent by abstraction later)

Saying an equation is a neural network depends on how one defines a neural network. If one says the neural network has more structure than just an equation, then an equation is not a neural network. For example, you can say a neural network must also be able to be trained on using an algorithm, which is information the equation lacks.

But we can make an analogy on some level of abstraction, under which two things which are different are equivalent on that level of abstraction.

For example, we can have a blue square 
    commutative diagram

or a triangle and a square, both with a base with the same length.

Now we are only focusing on computations from 

So the unit conversion visual and the neural network are not the same, but they are analogous. Likewise, the unit conversion equation and the neuron equation are not the same, but analogous.

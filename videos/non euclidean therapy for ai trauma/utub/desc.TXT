PATIENT ALICE:
An Artificial Intellgience suffering from hallucinations of a lost puppet show. These hallucinations need to be erased.

GENERATIVE MODEL TYPE: Diffusion-based.

PRESCRIBED TREATMENT: Model editing of the latent space. This method involves the pullback, the Jacobian matrix, and SVD.

Link to the paper this was based on:
"Unsupervised Discovery of Semantic Latent Directions in Diffusion Models"

And with only the no math portions:
TBD

A behind-the-scenes video going into more depth about the paper this was based off of will be made soon. It will address some issues not explained (due to time) in the video, such as the "circular issue" of needing the Jacobian J to compute J^T J to get the eigenvectors used to compute J.

Fixes (for the future update):
46m: this transpose should switch the elements to row a c and row b d
53m20s : this should say "square root of eigenvalues"
55m55s : this is an audio glitch. it should be 'you weren't such a'

In the future, an updated version with more visuals, especially during the SVD portion, will be made.

Warns AI of adversarial example dangers

the commercial itself has misclassified adv effects. halfway thru, breaks 4th wall- the narrator himself goes crazy.
    wait, that's not right
[ending- unexpected effects during this media production. this commercial failed to air. it has since been archived as a case study]

which one is the human?

the commercial itself is also alive
the narrator combats with it

<<<
humans are a simulacrum. they become detached from teh original meaning, and now the AI 'protect humans' even though there's none left

'protect humans? come to think of... I've never actually seen a human in person'

OR- do the humans now think they're AI, and are indistinguishable? 
'am I a human?'

some ai believe they're humans, but they actually might not be

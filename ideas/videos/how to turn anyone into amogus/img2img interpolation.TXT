Stable Diffusion IMG2IMG animation settings Pt. 1. I bought a new GPU for THIS!!

this takes an existing video and converts it using batch img2img

it doesn't take an interpolation b/w 2 images

<<<
search 'interpolation b/w images'

this doesn't use the latent space of the actual model used to get the outputs

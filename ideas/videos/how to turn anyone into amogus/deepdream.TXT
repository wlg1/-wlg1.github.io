Vincent Van Gogh in Google DeepDream Space

forcing an ai to make amogus:
train dreambooth on original amogus and its abstracts, NOT 'realistic that looks like amogus' (that's too confusing with too much other info), then output 'chair that looks like amogus', etc.
    start w/ slideshow & music, then have mathematical explanation that uses AI narration (avoid practical how-to b/c others can replicate your work). learn 'stable diffusion latent exploration' to find 'where the amogus is'.

        total video time: possibly 2 minutes. maybe 5.

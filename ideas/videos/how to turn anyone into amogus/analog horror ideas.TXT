amogus: modify input, prompt and parameters and keep running until get images that look realistic but also 'clever' amogus (just like salad pepe)

shoop amogus into an environment (contextual)
    backroom-ish (shouldn't look 100% realistic, but should still look realistic and somewhat identifiable)

Unsupervised Discovery of Semantic Latent Directions in Diffusion Models
    Riemannian geometry: manifold curvature. this is the path to travel (while exploring)
    how to control. steer.
    faint images of spacemen in the backrooms? no; as training manual art.
    warped space. geodesic. semantic

liminal spaces (regions) are defined as the 'interpolations' b/w samples in a semantic direction within latent space

be VERY high lvl in 1st video. no complex calculations, just map curved manifold to tangent
    at end of video, somehow say 'to be continued' (eg. say chapter 2 but cut off in middle)
    clips of this can be shorts and tiktok. entire thing can also be on tiktok; link to utub

have a blurry VHS 'training manual' similar to backrooms in b/w cut from amogus to SD latent space explanation

1st video: AI amogus liminal spaces

your job: explore the latent, liminal space and come back with an understanding of what the directions mean. map it.
liminal interploation, boundary
experiment tests to see if this technique works. casualities may occur (struck out)

later video, cryptic message typed out (like graffiti):
i am tired all teh time so i can dream while awake
(be on the verge of dreaming)

noise: dream to awake

welcome guests to chat with AI. figure out their mysteries (main storyline) while explaining their expertise hands-on (ie. if dmt neurosci chemistry, do simulations)
    bring guests from multiple fields (eg. math, chem); do test run first w/ no expectation to go on, then propose them to go on if you all work well together

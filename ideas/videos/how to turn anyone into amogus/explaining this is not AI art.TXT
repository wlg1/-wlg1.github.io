Do not mention any issues w/ AI art. Instead, say:

you can choose to train it entirely on things you made yourself
OR
everyone can choose 
[it's obvious it'd still work if it's voluntary, so no need to say this]

OR 

have a model that just uses only your own sketches and photos [this implies I voluntarily chose to teach it]
you can say 'I voluntarily chose to spend a good amount of time creating these for the sole purpose of corrupting this thing'

we're not going to sell this for profit, because we don't care about that. we're here to "blow stuff up in our own backyard" [too violent; say "we are only here to have fun"]

<<<<
Do not mention drawing or the joy of drawing. Say 'think of an amogus'. First, is all red. Then, multicolored. Then, don't require it to have...
[or use the cat example instead, b/c more varied]

but do discuss the joy of creativity, intuition, hard work.

finding the nikocado vector (the style)

stable diffusion VS custom trained filters- what happens?

stable diffusion:
"obama in the style of clint eastwood"
    perhaps need the right prompt words

the issue with all this generation is that it doesn't FILTER. it doesn't take an EXISTING image and filter over it (but I've seen it do this with images?)

"how to use stable diffusion as a filter"
"how to input an image into stable diffusion"

actually, it CAN do this:

negative prompt 'art'

ok... the tech exists. you're not creating new tech. you're explaining the INTERNALS of how it works, tying it with your math. so don't worry if it's easy... it should be very easy. the fun part is decomposing the vectors into features 
(hypothetical- we know they decompose into features, and how the feature calculations work, we just don't know what exactly they decompose into).
short- show the abominations, and give a quick math lesson (with more in longer video link)

You cannot escape using art, so you must use SD and have disclaimer that you're not focusing on the dataset, but HOW it works, just like a virus. anyways the controversy is good b/c it brings more views and debates. try to aim for photorealism using neg prompt
if WAY too controversial, keep the vid but don't make more in this fashion

How to fine tune to remove art? try to give it negative penalties if, from same dataset, it uses art?

Types of non-art images:
photos

Note that existing models are not fine tuned on specific people

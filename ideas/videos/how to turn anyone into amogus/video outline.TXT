2m long total:

Start with AI generated amogus interpolations

Then BZZZ (recognizable analog horror cut)

Fade in VHS warning similar to this:

Then recognizable blue gradient background

FIND THE AMOGUS
(a virus?)

Show NN, then transform intermediate layer nodes into manifolds

Have weird vaporwave shapes of curved manifold (latent space) X and in semantic (feature) space H. 'magnifying circle' shows amogus is somewhere within it

Unsupervised Discovery of Semantic Latent Directions in Diffusion Models
    Riemannian geometry: manifold curvature. this is the path to travel (while exploring)
    how to control. steer.
    faint images of spacemen in the backrooms? no; as training manual art.
    warped space. geodesic. semantic
    "However, we do not have any information on [liminal space distance]. It is definitely not a Euclidean metric."

brainstorm candidate premises:

- warning video to citizens
- trick video to ensnare citizens, or alien trying to impersonate
- educational video for [age group] (w/ puppets/teletubbies)
- training video for personnel

Training video for new personnel seems to make most sense b/c this math is 'esoteric' and 'advanced'. Aligns w/ non-euclidean structure of backrooms / aperture.

OR it's a commerical marketed towards AI suffering from pareidolia. This is never explicitly stated, but implied. It's like an old medical commerical. "Our top doctors and engineers will PullBack and correct you, eliminating the neurons that caused you to misfire"

"They'll enter the latent space of your brain" (similar to Inception)
Infographics of outlined figures shirnking into the magnified circle of your 'dream world'.

(You might be an AI)

First start w/ commerical, then later (more technical, less high lvl) is training video for the medical personnel who entre the AI's mind

Have you been seeing amogus recently?

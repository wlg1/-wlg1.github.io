If an entity has both properties (order/chaos), one can pick and choose depending on which perspective one wants to make an analogous match. So one can 'stretch' or bend to make an analogy; but given that there are other possibilities, this is not a strong indicator.

It is only when it is the ONLY possibility (ie. only has order properties) that there is a strong indicator of a correlated analogy.

note how much 'diff poss interpretations' (ie. it's yin yang, can be both order and chaos) there are. the less poss alternative interpretations, the more stat sigf the claimed hypothesis is.

dramatic storytelling, like singing in a play. hushed asmr occassionally. switch b/w dramatic and neutral, and steve blum. but make it fit acoustic music, too, so not TOO dramatic. more like a hushed bedtime storyteller, a cowboy. most of the time should be calm, cool, nonchalant. change it up- slight laughs, fast, slow, pauses, etc

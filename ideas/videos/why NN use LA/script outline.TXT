OUTLINE:

2: cat ppl, nose coords
3: nose conversion to nap
    put 'it's a NN' here, or too distracting? prob should put here b/c keeps it interesting
4: neural networks with with us all along
5: ear length + nose tip = data sample in 2D. vectors for 2D addition
    Purpose of vectors is more clear in 2D first, so say need to add in 2D.

    need this before else can't do unit conversion w/ ear len when show mod1 ~ mod2

    DO NOT use the word scalar. scalar can be moved?
    (or put at 3?? no, put it here b/c no need to add before this)
6: show both model 1 add and follow w/ nap 2 addition
    ear length conversion to nap after adding model 1 to show how it translates to model 2

    unrotate the y-axis to create model 2 addition

    must be done in conj w/ nap b/c else it seems pointless. first show add in mod1, then show it tog w/ mod2
    first show [1,0] then [1,1]
        
7: activation space, non interpretable
8: non-invertible, 2D matrix preview, conclusion

1: 2m

8: 2m (19m total)

Make it long to fit in formal things, showing depth of knowledge, which covers your bases and makes good first impression. Later, upload shorter videos (<5m or <10m) on diff/similar subjs for ppl w/ shorter attns spans. But first video should showcase what you have. These math edu vids are typically 20ms, longer than other youtube vids.

video 3:
2D weight mat (w/ identity)
negative inputs
neg weights
inverse matrix interpretations

<<<<<<<<
SCENE 2:
First only talk about predicting naps from nose tip (positive only)

Show nose tip on its own number line, growing in images. talk about its basis vector.

SCENE 3:
Then show it being mapped to nap, saying this change of units is a change of basis, and unit conversion. show this as a matrix.

<<<
SCENE 4:
Next, show this isn't enough. something is off; we need an adjustment. the values don't exactly match.

cat person 1 --> 2.5
cat person 2 --> 

Not enough predictive power. Need ear length.

introduce ear length on its own number line. 

<<<
Then show the 2 number lines being orthogonal, in order to form data points. First show basis vectors forming data pt. THen go in reverse; show the data pts being broken into each axis, separating. 

show adding basis vectors in 2D coordinate space is the same as adding basis vectors in 1D coordinate space. together, they create the data sample. the data sample would not be one without the other.

to add in 2D coordinate space, move vector. vectors are just arrows with length and magnitude; you can place them anywhere. the coordinate is just a description (1,1) - (1,0) = (0,1). It's really described by 2 points.

The vector is not a point; it is 2 points (head and tail), which are equivalent to magntiude and angle.

map this to nap ADDED to nose's mapping. use input [1,1]. say this is w1*nose + w2*ear = nap. show this as a matrix.

<<<
SCENE 5:

Map 2D basis to 1D basis

Then move these axis to the pinball machine to calculate the value of nap for that data pt. in each step of visual, show BOTH the matrix multp and the linear eqn analogous form.
    on the pinball machine visual, just rotate the bottom input (ear) to horizontal. 

<<<
SCENE 6

say the NN was in the visuals all along

<<<
SCENE 
negative weights

The nose tip can also be negative.

<<<
SCENE: conclusion

now we talk about caps. this is just a second measurement, and thus a second row in the matrix. show Model 1 and Model 2, showing the rotation animation. say in future video, will discuss matrix multp visually looks with more than 1 row in the weight matrix.

end by hinting at inverse of change of basis.

Just for fun, you never know what you're gonna get:
Generate picture from text, vice versa
    accurate descriptions, stories
    real time deploy and execute (just like auto-captions)
Generate picture [videos] [opinions] from music, vice versa

Fuse [music, pictures]

Don't have AI generate an entire song, have it create new sounds and samples that artists can use in their songs. Same w/ art- given a barebones template, artist fills it in / modifies it / uses it as inspiration

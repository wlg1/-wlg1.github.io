you can AI generate a video using what 'optimizes youtube recs to many' to test vids which gain a lot of views. explicitly state this- don't hide it. this is b/c the video will be strange (actually don't do this- too many will steal it, and youtube will dislike you for exposing them)
or don't explain your methodlogy- make it cryptic
just say it's 'ai gen to optimize' but don't say which parts of the video are, keep it a secret b/c it's a mystery, a puzzle game for people to figure out and speculate on.
first upload to new channel, then make video on your channel explaining what it is (only if it succeeds; if it doesn't, forget it)
train gen NN on a bunch of popular videos

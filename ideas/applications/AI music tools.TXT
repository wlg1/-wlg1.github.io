Boomy promises to just be like Autotune- a tool that doesn't replace, but makes music in new directions, and reduces barriers to entry. How to not replace artists? Instead of making a new song and replace the artists, have the AI fuse artists. The AI is trained on multiple artists and merges them together.

Another way is also to have the AI perform in real time- the artists sings/plays, and the AI continues, just like those youtube vids where they're given a sample and continue to play the rest by noticing its patterns. This is exciting novelty, like watching a sports game, as you don't know what's coming next. The AI can also duel the artist.

AI does not replace artist; it is only a way to create new sounds, like a synth or autotune

CANDIDATE NAMES:
* Medley- this is the best name because it's about composing short pieces together into a whole, and it sounds nice (but already exists). however, soft sounding 'dl' makes it hard to pronounce, unlike facebook, instagram, tiktok, twitter
* Relay- this is just as good as Medley but may be taken
** Relayer- good name b/c not a business (just album and game), and also has the 'action' feeling of 'doing'. hard to pronounce, for some. still rolls off tongue. may be too nerdy sounding
Relaytion- weird name, looks long
** RelayT - easy to prounounce, a good pun

if you find something that can potentially be put in, you can put a link to it. 

the real issue is 'junk'. people can spam stuff. so this a major hurdle if you have a public project open to anyone. one way this can be hidden is by these layers, or instances. so one layers that are apporved of are shown. so if you notice a spam layer, you can hide it by downvoting. but then bots can also vote up.

layers can be searched.

one way to prevent spam is with captcha, or limit post times.

Another way to reduce junk is to just limit a person to their own layer, or a few, for a space. That way, a person can skim thru a person's layer, then contribute or take (fork) from it if they want. They cannot add to that person's layer; they can only create a copy from it for themselves, and that will link to the person.

To prevent people from just taking w/o credit, an AI search engine will historically list out all similar ideas, down to no similar keywords only synonymous 'concept'.

possible ways:

1. take advantage of the 'tiktok attention span', where users are able to speed read and are drawn into scrolling thru multiple things one after the other. this will alllow them to go thru a lot of people's stuff w/o boredom

2. teach people to engage more with their curiosity. foster this community and mindset

3. AI summarizations

a lot of comments on the internet are 'junk', but that's b/c the convo thread is junk. if the right topics spur, direct, inspire people, they may produce more valuable insights

Two versions: a 'wrapper' around github and other sites, and its own site.

Instead of hosting your own DB w/ timestamps, just use github itself.

Each idea block is a link to a github version. The 'wrapper' UI is just to organize versions.

May combine w/ notion, too

PROS:
Database security and hosting for small scale (temporary proof of concept)
    https://thenewstack.io/github-repositories-werent-hacked/

CONS:
The issue is that each post is almost nothing. May be 'mis-using' github.
You still need to store the posts. 
There's no arrows about which post is referencing which other one.

<<<
fetch commits & branches from github

displays CERTAIN commits (the first post) as an idea block

idea blocks cannot be edited, but they can be deleted?

a post is stored in the repo, or doesn't have to be. but most impt is the timestamps are from github, so they can't be erased.

fetch post data from github repo, then display it as an idea block

links b/w posts are alos stored within the repo (like in a linked list or something similar)

branches is LITERALLY just a branch

EXAMPLE:

"Combine FPS with RTS players"
-> "Use both 1st person and 3rd person"

[it quickly becomes disorgniazed if too many replies]
but you can create a branch at ANY place, and pick and choose which parts to copy
    to do this, an entire new repo is created

addicting to read, like a comments thread, but customized and filtered. AND timestamped.

to get junk replies out, you moderate your own copy of a branch and can approve/delete idea blocks. anyone can create their own copy.

to check for similarity, an AI scours this to check for ideas already used (with synonyms, etc). not perfect, but close enough.

threads are not easily searchable for ideas. they're lost and buried. but in this space, their purpose isn't for discussion, but to generate ideas. that PURPOSE is the main difference. filtering out other types of discussion threads- directing these to only focus on generating ideas- clears away junk and makes them searchable and visible.

upvotes/downvotes don't add to total karma, or visibility, they just exist on that idea block itself. no promotion. perhaps no downvotes.

how to prevent others' branches from drowning out your own?

adhd scrolling. display multiple related ones all at once in clusters. thinking 'fast'; speed reading. this is NOT linear. multiple ways to organize (and highly sugessted what to srot by- no default sorting, and it recs multiple ways to filter).

see an entire birds eye view of a map of branches and forks, how many there are. zoom in to one spot.

[Branching is to create another line of development in the project without affecting the main branch or repository. Forking, on the other hand, is to make a clone of the repository on your GitHub account without affecting the main repository.]

So actually it's not branches, it's forks. Branch is more like working on a diff subsystem. These terms can be renamed, such as 'instances' or 'layers' (layer seems like the best word for 'fork', reminiscient of parallel worlds).

'paths' and 'subthreads' are within a layer. if in VR, can use multiple fingers to collapse and explore.

why use this wrapper?

Because by displaying these posts in a way where they're all visible at once, like posts in a thread, one can easily add ideas. displaying just by file name is cumbersome (one has to click thru each one) but 

<<<
why not use social media

social media are moderated and are at the mercy of the company. they can remove threads, reorganize them completely, etc.

<<<
why not use a forum format?

you can, but it's not as clean, since you have avatar, signatures, etc. organizing ideas blocks as a graph you can zoom in, branch, etc is much better. you can't use branching in forum templates where you copy ENTIRE threads? perhaps you can but there are too many unnecessary functions. this is NOT a discussion forum; they're showerthoughts.

keep it mid. too many users right off the bat isn't good. like the intranet in darpa, use it for streaming / small group purposes first. this beta test of curated, academically sound users prevents junk.

use it for just 'any ideas'. keep it casual. for implementations, keep them casual and simple too, just like tweets.

b/c it's mid on your mid youtube channel, less chance ppl will steal it. if they do, compete with them. have copyrights in place for lawsuits, and appeal to popularity of userbase to get support and recognition (which is more impt for legacy).

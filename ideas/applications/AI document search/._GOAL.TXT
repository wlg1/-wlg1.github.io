Dreamwalk: Component 0

Given questions + other inputs, create a pipeline to create DRAFTS of experiments, papers, questions, etc.
    lots of user feedback during pipeline tuning. it's not fully automated; no paper should be.

<<<<<<<
The organization and interface is the important part. Format using prompts, which call other prompts in a decision tree

<<<
hard part of pipeline:

INCORPORATE THE RESEARCHER IN. The researchers need to be able to understand papers, not just blindly follow ai. So the ai must be able to teach the researchers in clear ways. Raw gpt output is too dense and not always optimal, so you must tune it for this, along with formats obtained using pipeline tools.

<<<<
not sure if possible, or how, to do yet:

given a latex template, fill in the tempalte?
chatgpt to understand repos?
use gpt to understand text on a web page?
summarize video by subtitles? summarize/find by image rec?
use with logic prover/cheker?

<<<
easy part of pipeline:

combining:
tune it to be a scholar (fine tune prompts)
get pdf (requests API code by gpt / future gpt plugin)
store pdf (by langchain, vector db)
understand pdf (chatpdf)
calculations (wolfram gpt)
latex (texgpt)
organize (notion ai)

???:
Reflexion
auto gpt 4
hugging gpt

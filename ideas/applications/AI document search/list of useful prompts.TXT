The relevant suggestions will appear:

summarize this page/section/paragraph (in layman's terms, that a biologist would understand, that a physicist...)
    create a table of contents with links to the paragraph it refs

find a (rabbit hole stack) of refs backing up each statement, and the statement of that statement, etc. down to 'axioms/base assumptions'

Convert from input to latex
    images separate, come from refs

given paper, list out possible new experiments to try

make quizzes from it

convert text into format for notion/other software

take video + subs + audio and summarize; cut out relevant snippets/timestamps based on summary
(notion exports -> plain text)
(text -> excel)
    Given the format "=x word", I want you to store every word [as a dictionary key]

completely change format, with x being y, except for x2 being z
    similar to sql

correct all the grammar. translate.

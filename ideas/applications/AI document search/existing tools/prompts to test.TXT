It can do it already. see 'research output 1'

Wait... these aren't real papers or authors. They're hallucinations. Try telling it to search the web

Using a web search on arxiv, find the latest papers on neural network editing, and make a table comparing their experimental results

    it fails; it cannot connect to the web! it again hallucinates

autogpt: 'web search research output 1'
    Goal 1: Search arxiv on the web
    Goal 2: find papers on neural network editing
    Goal 3: compare experiments
    Goal 4: make tables comparing experimental results
    Goal 5: export tables to csv format

    it does search the web for actual papers

    its continuous interface is sort of messy and you don't really know what it's doing

<<<<<<<<<
it seems the memory used isn't for storing and comparing docs; it's for conversational memory

autogpt can browse the web, but it doesn't really know what it's doing. a safer, less random program can be built that directly tells gpt what to look for and how to do it (using code). simply instructing it using NLP is bound for failure; the NLP is good for generating patterned responses, but less so for telling it to understand tasks. it's too risky and random, and frustrating to get desired exact results. also, the program runs with too much unnecessary output for the user to parse through.

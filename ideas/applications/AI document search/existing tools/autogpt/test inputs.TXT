Input:Invent a research plan for machine learning interpretability
SYSTEM:  Human feedback: Invent a research plan for machine learning interpretability
RESEARCH-GPT THOUGHTS: I think the first step should be to gather information on the topic or task at hand. We can use the 'google' command to start researching.
REASONING: Before we can start writing code or analyzing data, we should understand the problem statement and possible solutions. A thorough search will give us an idea of existing methods and help us identify gaps or areas for improvement.
PLAN:
-  Use 'google' command to search for relevant information
-  Save important information to files for easy retrieval
-  Analyze the information to identify gaps and research areas
-  Use GPT agents to delegate simple tasks and remain efficient
CRITICISM: I need to make sure I don't get overwhelmed with too much information and keep the focus on the initial task
NEXT ACTION:  COMMAND = google ARGUMENTS = {'input': 'machine learning research techniques'}

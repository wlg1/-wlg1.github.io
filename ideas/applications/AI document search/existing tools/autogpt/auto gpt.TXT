Research-GPT is: an AI designed to write code for machine learning research and convert its analysis into text and latex papers

compare papers, news, blogs, threads, docs in a way the reader understands
write code for machine learning research 
convert its analysis into text and latex papers
log and search experiments in an organized way
generate ideas for experiments and future research directions based on papers it read

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
tests:

google the paper "Locating and Editing Factual Associations in GPT" and read its arxiv pdf

     cons- it takes time, is slow to think

 I apologize for the confusion earlier. Having only the name of the paper was not enough to do a specific search. I need to clarify whether you would like me to perform a Google search for the paper, or whether you already have a copy of the paper and want me to summarize its contents.

Input:Download the paper for arxiv

 I apologize again for any confusion earlier. It seems I misunderstood your request. As an AI, I am unable to download files directly. However, here is a guide for how to download the paper from arXiv: 1. Go to the arXiv website. 2. In the search bar, type in "Locating and Editing Factual Associations in GPT". 3. Click on the title of the paper to access the abstract page. 4. Scroll down to the "Download" section and click on the link to the pdf version of the paper. Once you have downloaded the paper, you can save it to a file and read it at your leisure. Let me know if you have any further requests or if there's anything else that I can help you with!

CON: cannot download papers!

https://github.com/Torantulino/Auto-GPT#-features
Internet access for searches and information gathering
Long-Term and Short-Term memory management
GPT-4 instances for text generation

seems like the tasks are done in 'goals'. but only if continuous mode used, which is dangerous

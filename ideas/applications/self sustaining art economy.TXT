There's too much content to consume, and people don't get actual feedback on them. Current bots are fake b/c they don't actually listen, they post a pre-recorded comment and disregard the content. Actual AI that can listen will leave comments that feel more real- not only that, all the AI are in communities and can share the content with other AI. The AIs form their own culture where they can have 100 AI listen to 1 obscure kid's song and form a community around it, having their tastes revolve around those patterns. But having these 1-sided AIs can be no fun- so instead, one can create AI with their own tastes (create meaning self-gen, just as self merging with no human instruction), and they can criticize or like the song/artwork/story/video/tweet/etc. With all these AI, there will be enough to consume content.

Can content consuming be a real job? Can you be paid to consume- is it self-sustaining? Say a company pays you to consume, and by consuming, you write reviews and spread info and thus contribute to marketing, so the company pays you more. Can AI also work as consumers? Can AI own money and contribute to not only the economy, but innovation to support good businesses and not support bad ones? It would be illegal to artifically create AI that supports your own business when you design them to revolve around liking the unique things your business does, even if they're bad for real people on average.

Pay viewers to watch you -> Advertisers pay you -> You pay advertisers -> Pay viewers to watch you
paid viewing, paid criticism

self-sustaining ecosystem- how?

Main Question: What would happen if we compared the Jaccard similarity of an image and one of its occlusions?

Hypothesis: We expect a higher similarity score for the image and its occlusions than for the image and other images.

---
Main Outcome: Jaccard Similarity was high for the image and one of its occlusions

Support/Oppose Hypothesis: Supports

---
Summary of Tests: 
Between occlusions VS others

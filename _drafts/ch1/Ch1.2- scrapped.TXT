But this is still not a satisfactory answer. We know what the values in $$W$$ represent. But we still have to clarify why this multiplication correctly "moves" from X to O. 

Multiply W by [1 0] : shows [1 0] moved to [1 -1.5]

In this example, <img src="/cob/face1.PNG" width="50" height="40"> stays from <span style="color:#FA8072">1</span> to <span style="color:red">1</span>. If we look at the figure again, note that it doesn't move horizontally:

![2mod_vecs](/cob/2mod_out.PNG)

But if we look at another example where it moves from <span style="color:#FA8072">1</span> to <span style="color:red">4</span>, as we see in the figure below:

[fig]

What does this change **MEAN**? The answer is the following:

<p align="center">
<b><span style="color:#CBC3E3">A face length of unit 1</span> = <span style="color:#FA8072">1</span>*<span style="color:#CBC3E3">1</span> implies that there are <span style="color:red">4</span>*<span style="color:#CBC3E3">1</span> = <span style="color:orange">4 units 'likely to be cat'</span></b>
</p>

<p align="center">
<b>A face length of unit 1 implies that there are 4 units 'likely to be cat'</b>
</p>

In Model 1, when we multiply $$\color{#FA8072}{1} * \color{#CBC3E3
}{0.5}$$, it means "a face length of 0.5". Thus, in Model 2, $$\color{red}{4} * 0.5 = \color{orange}{2}$$ means:

<p align="center">
<b><span style="color:#CBC3E3">A face length of unit 0.5</span> = <span style="color:#FA8072">1</span>*<span style="color:#CBC3E3">0.5</span> implies that there are <span style="color:red">4</span>*<span style="color:#CBC3E3">0.5</span> = <span style="color:orange">2 units 'likely to be cat'</span></b>
</p>

<p align="center">
<b>A face length of unit 0.5 implies that there are 2 units 'likely to be cat'</b>
</p>


$$\color{#FA8072}{1} * 0.5  + \color{#ADD8E6}{0} * 2 = \color{#CBC3E3}{0.5}$$

And do the same thing for Model 2, except we subsitute the values:

$$\color{red}{4} * 0.5  + \color{blue}{1.5} * 2$$

However, it's important to note that we are not always scaling the <span style="color:#CBC3E3">input</span> by a <span style="color:red">factor</span>; if we tried to apply this to an input <span style="color:#CBC3E3">0</span>, we would never be able to change it. Instead, we are substituting 1 with 4; or in other words, "mapping" 1 to 4.


However, it's important to note that we are not always scaling <span style="color:#FA8072">1</span> by a factor of <span style="color:red">4</span>; if we tried to apply this to <span style="color:#FA8072">0</span>, we would never be able to change it. Instead, we are substituting 1 with 4; or in other words, "mapping" 1 to 4.

In summary: Every input <span style="color:#CBC3E3">(such as 0.5)</span> applied to the <span style="color:#FA8072">first measurement, face</span>, is also applied to the <span style="color:orange">second measurement, cat</span>, found by substituting <span style="color:#FA8072">1</span> with <span style="color:red">4</span>.

$$\def\a{\color{#ADD8E6}{0}}
\def\c{\color{#ADD8E6}{1}}
\begin{bmatrix} \a \\ \c \end{bmatrix}$$ to $$\def\a{\color{blue}{1.5}}
\def\c{\color{blue}{1}}
\begin{bmatrix} \a \\ \c \end{bmatrix}$$

 Recall that the difference between Model 1 and Model 2 is the choice of basis vectors, and each vector in a coordinate space is defined using basis vectors. Thus, our translation will involve rewriting Model 1's basis vectors in terms of Model 2's basis vectors. Then the rewritten Model 1 basis vectors will be used to rewrite vector I in terms of Model 2's basis vectors. This is called a "Change of Basis", and can be done using matrix multiplication. --->

FOOTNOTE: WHY STRANGE PROCEDURE?

One question you may ask is: why does finding the answer to the first row of O require using the first row of W? 

The dot product adds two scaled vectors from the same dimension. To understand what the dot product is doing, all you need to know is why 1D vector addition works.

VECTOR ADDITION:
[First explain vector addition; everything follows from assuming it's true]
[show vectors as just values. elementary school addition / subtraction]

The reason we add vectors in 1D by placing the tail of B onto A, or vice versa, is because we can think of them simply as instructions: go left twice, then go right once.

...which is also shown in the 3Blue1Brown video [].

... thus, the reason why the first row of O (colored) uses the first row of W (colored diff) is because we project down the vectors c and d only by their first coordinate, which is the first row of W.

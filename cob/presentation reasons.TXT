What should be first? Something simple yet interesting, as a hook. Thus, put the German-English example first, and the more fundamental but esoteric (why basis vectors) second.

Should animation be in both the German-English and the 'why basis'? Or just in 'why basis?' The purpose of the animation is to show that the coordinate system is independent of the Concept Space (Reality). If I start w/ one Concept Space, it'll defeat this purpose. But if I show the animation twice, the second animation won't be as effective, as the reader already knows what's coming. BUT perhaps they should- otherwise, they'd question what's the purpose fo seeing this animation. The 'why basis' provides a deeper insight than just seeing the animation lock in place- it explains that it's relative to the basis, which the first part doesn't. Thus, put it twice. The second time the reader sees it, they won't be lost as they have a vague idea of why they're seeing it, but have not seen a more formal, thorough explanation of what's going on.

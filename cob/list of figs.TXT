List of Figures:
NN on top, matrix multiplication on bottom

1:
[drawings of cat/rat abstracted into the circles: pic, shapes on top of pic, and shapes only. label that the left side is an entity.]

[shapes only, labeling which is body size and which is face length]

[coordinate space of body size vs face length, with basis vectors on c = bodysize 1 and d = facelength 1]

[show picture of cat pic on coordinate space, right side showing vector addition]

[figure showing the analogy: 
Bigger body + Shorter face = Cat
2 * [body pic X] + 0.5*[face pic Y] = value 2X+0.5Y on cat axes ]

ALSO IMPT:
[coordinate space of body size vs face length, showing cat and rat, but onto it fades 'likely a cat' and 'likely a rat'. then it shifts.]

MOST IMPT: PUT THIS IN SUMMARY AT END OF SECTION, AND AT RECAP AT START OF NEW SECTION
[Model 1, and Model 1 on top of Model 2. Sys 2 'jk'. Label Concepts.]

ALSO IMPT:
[[2 0.5] in Model 1 and [2 0.5] in Model 1 on 2. I is animated]

[now fill in what [2 0.5] is in Sys 2]

[picture of X as input vector, W as arrow, O=WX as Model 2 vector on [cat pic]]

[fading gif of changing abstractions back to actual pics; place images on coord sys]

<<<
[first show coordinate space labeling gift as poison]

ALSO IMPT:
[animation transforming poison and gift pics to English coordinate space. The vector does not move. Label first Sys as German, second as English.]

[show coordinate space w/ Geschenk]

[show a place in Switzerland not on the map]

<<<
[put vector O on coord sys]

<<<
2:
Dot product breakdown b/w 2 coordinate systems (explain 1st step of matrix mult)

<<<
1+:
animation of Reality going System 1 to System 2 WITHOUT coordinate systems
same animation but showing System 1's basis vectors
[System 1, and System 1 on top of System 2. Label Concepts.]

Reality animation- choose transformations, get rid of Wait b/w
Reality Stills (equivalence)
Coordinate system on top of moving reality
No coord sys vs coord sys
2 Coordinate systems on top of Reality, showing Concept labeled 2 diff ways
Reality animation using only one basis vector
2 translated coord systems, [-1 2] ~ [-4 1]
Color/boxed matrix multiplication labeling corresponding to coord systems

Splitting [poison] and [gift]: first 1D (animated), then 2D
Splitting circles vs not circles
Flower Reality, Dataset as numbers
Latent spaces of NN, Model vs Reality
Figure showing neurons as basis vectors

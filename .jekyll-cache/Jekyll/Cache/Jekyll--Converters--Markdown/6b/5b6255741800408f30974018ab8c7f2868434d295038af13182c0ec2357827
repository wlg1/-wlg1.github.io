<a href="">Neural Circuit Experiments</a>
</b></p>

<p>Neural Circuit Experiments aim to find analogous patterns in neural network activations based on inputs with varying similarities. Why study Neural Circuit Experiments?</p>
<ul>
<li>By uncovering the black box that obscures how neural networks make decisions, practitioners will have more control over debugging neural networks to do what they want. </li>
<li>By understanding which parts of a neural network perform what function, practitioners will be able to dissect neural networks to retrieve the part they need, and apply transfer learning to fine tune that part to suit their own, specific goals.</li>
</ul>

<p>These experiments are housed in a Github repo with Colab notebooks that walk a reader through how the experiments were conducted.</p>

<p>When studying new improvements to neural networks, many people run into the following problem:</p>

<p align="center">
<b>How do these unfamiliar mathematical concepts relate to neural networks?</b></p>

<p>This blog solves these problems by explaining all the required prerequisites needed to understand the terminology from the bottom up.[^1]. It also gets to the point: it only says what issues this concept solves for this neural network paper, nothing more.</p>

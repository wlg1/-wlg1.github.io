<p>Main Question: What would happen if we compared the Jaccard similarity of an image and one of its occlusions?</p>

<p>Hypothesis: We expect a higher similarity score for the image and its occlusions than for the image and other images.</p>

<hr />
<p>Main Outcome: Jaccard Similarity was high for the image and one of its occlusions</p>

<p>Support/Oppose Hypothesis: Supports</p>

<hr />
<p>Summary of Tests: 
Between occlusions VS others</p>

<hr />
<p>Code: Tutorial 1</p>

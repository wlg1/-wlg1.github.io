<p><strong>Ch1.2: Why use dot product in matrix multiplication?</strong>
<!---WHY THE ALGEBRAIC PROCEDURE OF MATRIX MULTIPLICATION WORKS---></p>

<p>Let‚Äôs re-visit the problem of finding the value of \(O\). In other words, how do we find the new label of <img src="/cob/cat.PNG" width="50" height="40" /> in Model 2?</p>

<p><img src="/cob/2mod_out.PNG" alt="2mod_vecs" /></p>

<p>In a linear algebra class, one learns that this can be done using matrix multiplication. But why does the algebraic procedure of matrix multiplication work? Why does the first step specifically use the dot product of the first row and the input vector? What even is a dot product?</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs figure this out by first understanding what we need to know to calculate the values of \(O\) that represents data sample <img src="/cob/cat.PNG" width="50" height="40" />. All data samples in Model 2 are represented by two measurements:</p>
<p align="center">
1) How likely it is to be a <span style="color:orange">Cat</span>
</p>
<p align="center">
2) How likely it is to be a <span style="color:green">Rat</span>

$$O = \def\a{\color{orange}{Cat}}
\def\b{\color{green}{Rat}}
\begin{bmatrix} \a \\ \b \end{bmatrix}$$  
</p>
<p>So if we want to find the value of \(O\), we need to calculate these two values. Recall in the previous section that we were able to calculate the value of ‚Äúhow likely to be cat‚Äù using the values of ‚Äúface length‚Äù and ‚Äúbody size‚Äù:</p>

<p>[Shorter face + Bigger body = Likely a Cat</p>

<p>\(\color{red}{face_{cat}} * 0.5  + \color{blue}{body_{cat}} * 2\) = 0.5(face_cat)+2(body_cat) on cat axes ]</p>

<p>Notice how this resembles the following dot product:</p>

<p align="center">
$$
\def\a{\color{red}{face_{cat}}}
\def\b{\color{blue}{body_{cat}}}
\begin{bmatrix} \a &amp; \b \end{bmatrix}  
\cdot  \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix} 
= \color{red}{face_{cat}} * 0.5  + \color{blue}{body_{cat}} * 2$$
</p>

<p>Not only that, but it resembles the first step of matrix multiplication:</p>

<p align="center">
$$
\def\a{\color{red}{face_{cat}}}
\def\b{\color{blue}{body_{cat}}}
\begin{bmatrix} \a &amp; \b \\ ? &amp; ? \end{bmatrix}  
\begin{bmatrix} 0.5 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix} 
= \begin{bmatrix} \a * 0.5  + \b * 2 \\ ?\end{bmatrix} $$
</p>

<p>In fact, the matrix on the left is none other than \(W\) from the figure above, which is used in the equation \(O = WX\).</p>

\[\def\a{\color{red}{1}}
\def\b{\color{blue}{1.5}}
\def\c{\color{red}{-1.5}}
\def\d{\color{blue}{1}}
\begin{bmatrix} \a &amp; \b \\ \c &amp; \d \end{bmatrix}  

=
\def\a{\color{red}{face_{cat}}}
\def\b{\color{blue}{body_{cat}}}
\begin{bmatrix} \a &amp; \b \\ ? &amp; ? \end{bmatrix}\]

<p>We mentioned that \(face_{cat}\) and \(body_{cat}\) are weights that denote how important each feature is in the calculation. For example, if body size is more important, we‚Äôd set \(body_{cat} = 1.5 &gt; face_{cat} = 1\).</p>

<p>But what does this dot product <strong>mean</strong> in terms of our dataset? To make its meaning easier to understand, let \(face_{cat}=4\), and let‚Äôs ignore the second term by setting \(body_{cat} = ?\)</p>

\[\color{red}{W}\color{#CBC3E3}{X} = \color{orange}{O}\]

<p align="center">
$$
\def\a{\color{red}{(face_{cat}=4)}}
\def\b{\color{#CBC3E3}{0.5}}
\def\c{\color{red}{4}}
\def\d{\color{orange}{2}}
\begin{bmatrix} \a &amp; ? \\ ? &amp; ? \end{bmatrix}  
\begin{bmatrix} \b \\ ? \end{bmatrix} 
= \begin{bmatrix} \c * \b = \d  \\ ?\end{bmatrix} $$
</p>

<p align="center">
<b><span style="color:#CBC3E3">0.5 units of face length</span></b> <span style="font-size:20px">&#8594;</span> <span style="color:orange">2 units of 'likely to be cat'</span>
</p>

<p>In other words, ‚Äúfor every face length of unit 1, there are 4 units of cat‚Äù. Thus, for half a unit of face length, we have half of the proportionate amount of cat, which is 2. Doesn‚Äôt this sound familiar, like unit conversion?</p>

<p>[picture of meter to feet conversion]</p>

<p>For every 1 meter, there are 3.28 feet. So if an entity is 2 meters long:</p>

<p align="center">
$$
\def\a{\color{red}{(meter_{feet}=3.28)}}
\def\b{\color{#CBC3E3}{2}}
\def\c{\color{red}{3.28}}
\def\d{\color{orange}{6.56}}
\begin{bmatrix} \a \end{bmatrix}  
\begin{bmatrix} \b \end{bmatrix} 
= \begin{bmatrix} \c * \b = \d \end{bmatrix} $$
</p>

<p align="center">
<b><span style="color:#CBC3E3">2 units of meter</span></b> <span style="font-size:20px">&#8594;</span> <span style="color:orange">6.56 units of feet</span>
</p>

<p>Indeed, one dot product step is analogous to 1D matrix multiplication; so two dot product steps would be analogous to 2D matrix multiplication. At last, we realize that matrix multiplication, or ‚ÄúChange of Basis‚Äù, is none other than  unit conversion multiplication, or ‚ÄúChange of Units‚Äù. That is, \(O\) refers to the same quantity that \(X\) refers to, except the two measure it using different units.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>But in contrast to the 1D ‚Äúmeter to feet‚Äù example, the ‚Äúface and body to cat‚Äù example uses <strong>two</strong> measurements to find the value of cat. Matrix multiplication allows for a change of <strong>multiple</strong> units, or multiple dimensions. The weight matrix \(W\) is analogous to the conversion factor.</p>

<p>In summary:</p>

<p>1) A <strong>Dot Product</strong> is used to convert multiple units into a new unit</p>

<p>2) Multiple dot products are used in <strong>Matrix Multiplication</strong> to find multiple new units</p>

<p>Just like how each row of \(X\) measures the same entity but using a different unit (a basis vector of Model 1), each row of \(O\) uses a different unit (a basis vector of Model 2) to measure the same entity, and each is calculated using the known measurements from \(X\).</p>

<p>Since each new measurement is calculating using the <strong>same input</strong>, but with <span><i>different conversion factors</i></span>, each new value of \(O\) is calculating using the <strong>same input vector</strong> \(X\), but with <span><i>different rows of</i></span> \(W\).</p>

<hr />
<p>Now let‚Äôs match terms in these equations to their geometric representation from the figure above:</p>

<p>In Model 1, \(\def\a{\color{#FA8072}{1}}
\def\c{\color{#FA8072}{0}}
\begin{bmatrix} \a \\ \c \end{bmatrix}\) labels <img src="/cob/face1.PNG" width="50" height="40" />. In Model 2, \(\def\a{\color{red}{1}}
\def\c{\color{red}{-1.5}}
\begin{bmatrix} \a \\ \c \end{bmatrix}\) labels <img src="/cob/face1.PNG" width="50" height="40" />.</p>

<p>Thus, \(\def\a{\color{red}{1}}
\def\c{\color{red}{-1.5}}
\begin{bmatrix} \a \\ \c \end{bmatrix}\) is where the data sample previously labeled by the basis vector \(\def\a{\color{#FA8072}{1}}
\def\c{\color{#FA8072}{0}}
\begin{bmatrix} \a \\ \c \end{bmatrix}\) is sent.</p>

<p>\(\color{red}{face_{cat}}\) = <span style="color:red">1</span> is the <span style="color:orange">Cat</span> coordinate of the vector \(\def\a{\color{red}{1}}
\def\c{\color{red}{-1.5}}
\begin{bmatrix} \a \\ \c \end{bmatrix}\) in Model 2.</p>

<p>The <span style="color:blue">1.5</span> is the <span style="color:orange">Cat</span> coordinate of the vector \(\def\a{\color{blue}{1.5}}
\def\c{\color{blue}{1}}
\begin{bmatrix} \a \\ \c \end{bmatrix}\).</p>

<p>Given the fact that the vertical axis of Model 2 denotes ‚Äúlikely to be rat‚Äù, it‚Äôs pretty clear now what the second row should be:</p>

\[\def\a{\color{red}{face_{cat}}}
\def\b{\color{blue}{body_{cat}}}
\def\c{\color{red}{face_{Rat}}}
\def\d{\color{blue}{body_{Rat}}}
\begin{bmatrix} \a &amp; \b \\ \c &amp; \d \end{bmatrix}\]

<p>So we arrived at several conclusions:</p>

<p>1) Because Model 2 uses the old measurements of Model 1 to calculate its new measurements, the matrix \(W\) contains the weights needed to determine how important each old measurement is for each new measurement</p>

<p>2) Each row of the matrix contains weights to calculate one <strong>new</strong> measurement</p>

<p>3) Each column of the matrix contains weights for how one <strong>OLD</strong> measurement is used</p>

<p>4) The dot product is applied between every row of the matrix and the input vector because the same input vector uses different weights of the old measurements for every different new measurement</p>

<!---

[before, just discussed 'weights' but did not relate geometrically what it is]

But this is still not a satisfactory answer. We know what the values in $$W$$ represent. But we still have to clarify why this multiplication correctly "moves" from X to O. 

Why is [0.5, 2] used for both Model 1 and Model 2? 

Multiply W by [1 0] : shows [1 0] moved to [1 -1.5]

A shift in the basis vectors means an analogous shift in Model 2. How does matrix multiplication calculate how much this shift is? Why do we place each new basis vector in a column?

In this example, <img src="/cob/face1.PNG" width="50" height="40"> stays from <span style="color:#FA8072">1</span> to <span style="color:red">1</span>. If we look at the figure again, note that it doesn't move horizontally:

![2mod_vecs](/cob/2mod_out.PNG)

But if we look at another example where it moves from <span style="color:#FA8072">1</span> to <span style="color:red">4</span>, as we see in the figure below:

[fig]

What does this change **MEAN**? The answer is the following:

<p align="center">
<b><span style="color:#CBC3E3">A face length of unit 1</span> = <span style="color:#FA8072">1</span>*<span style="color:#CBC3E3">1</span> implies that there are <span style="color:red">4</span>*<span style="color:#CBC3E3">1</span> = <span style="color:orange">4 units 'likely to be cat'</span></b>
</p>

<p align="center">
<b>A face length of unit 1 implies that there are 4 units 'likely to be cat'</b>
</p>

In Model 1, when we multiply $$\color{#FA8072}{1} * \color{#CBC3E3
}{0.5}$$, it means "a face length of 0.5". Thus, in Model 2, $$\color{red}{4} * 0.5 = \color{orange}{2}$$ means:

<p align="center">
<b><span style="color:#CBC3E3">A face length of unit 0.5</span> = <span style="color:#FA8072">1</span>*<span style="color:#CBC3E3">0.5</span> implies that there are <span style="color:red">4</span>*<span style="color:#CBC3E3">0.5</span> = <span style="color:orange">2 units 'likely to be cat'</span></b>
</p>

<p align="center">
<b>A face length of unit 0.5 implies that there are 2 units 'likely to be cat'</b>
</p>


$$\color{#FA8072}{1} * 0.5  + \color{#ADD8E6}{0} * 2 = \color{#CBC3E3}{0.5}$$

And do the same thing for Model 2, except we subsitute the values:

$$\color{red}{4} * 0.5  + \color{blue}{1.5} * 2$$

However, it's important to note that we are not always scaling the <span style="color:#CBC3E3">input</span> by a <span style="color:red">factor</span>; if we tried to apply this to an input <span style="color:#CBC3E3">0</span>, we would never be able to change it. Instead, we are substituting 1 with 4; or in other words, "mapping" 1 to 4.


However, it's important to note that we are not always scaling <span style="color:#FA8072">1</span> by a factor of <span style="color:red">4</span>; if we tried to apply this to <span style="color:#FA8072">0</span>, we would never be able to change it. Instead, we are substituting 1 with 4; or in other words, "mapping" 1 to 4.

In summary: Every input <span style="color:#CBC3E3">(such as 0.5)</span> applied to the <span style="color:#FA8072">first measurement, face</span>, is also applied to the <span style="color:orange">second measurement, cat</span>, found by substituting <span style="color:#FA8072">1</span> with <span style="color:red">4</span>.

<p>Remember how the values of \(X\) were calculated using the basis vectors. The first value, the face length of \(X\), was calculated using:</p>

<p align="center">
$$
\def\a{\color{#FA8072}{1}}
\def\b{\color{#ADD8E6}{0}}
\begin{bmatrix} \a &amp; \b \end{bmatrix}  
\cdot  \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix} 
= \color{#FA8072}{1} * 0.5  + \color{#ADD8E6}{0} * 2 = \color{#CBC3E3}{0.5}$$
</p>

<p>This is just like the dot product we saw to find the <span style="color:orange">Cat</span> value in Model 2.</p>

<p align="center">
$$
\def\a{\color{red}{face_{cat}}}
\def\b{\color{blue}{body_{cat}}}
\begin{bmatrix} \a &amp; \b \end{bmatrix}  
\cdot  \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix} 
= \color{red}{1} * 0.5  + \color{blue}{1.5} * 2$$
</p>

<p>We were focused on calculating the values of \(O\), but now we see that it‚Äôs very similar to calculating the values of \(X\)!</p>

<p>[color code this to NN too]</p>

<!---
$$\def\a{\color{#ADD8E6}{0}}
\def\c{\color{#ADD8E6}{1}}
\begin{bmatrix} \a \\ \c \end{bmatrix}$$ to $$\def\a{\color{blue}{1.5}}
\def\c{\color{blue}{1}}
\begin{bmatrix} \a \\ \c \end{bmatrix}$$

 Recall that the difference between Model 1 and Model 2 is the choice of basis vectors, and each vector in a coordinate space is defined using basis vectors. Thus, our translation will involve rewriting Model 1's basis vectors in terms of Model 2's basis vectors. Then the rewritten Model 1 basis vectors will be used to rewrite vector I in terms of Model 2's basis vectors. This is called a "Change of Basis", and can be done using matrix multiplication. --->

<!---
FOOTNOTE: WHY STRANGE PROCEDURE?

One question you may ask is: why does finding the answer to the first row of O require using the first row of W? 

The dot product adds two scaled vectors from the same dimension. To understand what the dot product is doing, all you need to know is why 1D vector addition works.

VECTOR ADDITION:
[First explain vector addition; everything follows from assuming it's true]
[show vectors as just values. elementary school addition / subtraction]

The reason we add vectors in 1D by placing the tail of B onto A, or vice versa, is because we can think of them simply as instructions: go left twice, then go right once.

...which is also shown in the 3Blue1Brown video [].

... thus, the reason why the first row of O (colored) uses the first row of W (colored diff) is because we project down the vectors c and d only by their first coordinate, which is the first row of W.

2.5, 2</p>

<p>‚ÄúA face length of unit 1 denotes that it‚Äôs -2 units ‚Äòlikely to be cat‚Äù</p>

<p>Or in other words, ‚ÄúA face length of unit 1 denotes that it‚Äôs 2 units NOT ‚Äòlikely to be cat‚Äù</p>

<p>If there are 2 meters, we multiply 2 meters.
[picture of 2 meters, or 2 * 3.28 feet]</p>

<p>If the face length is 0.5, that means it‚Äôs 2 units not likely to be a cat.
[top is face length, bottom is -+ line denoting cat chance]</p>

<hr />
<p>[First multiply by identity matrix, which leaves expression unchanged.]
The basis vectors in Model 1 form I, the identity matrix.</p>

<p>fig: show that Identity * X in Sys 1 is ‚Äòanalogous‚Äô to W * X</p>

<p>Think of multiplying by the input vector X as instructions on how to get the coordinates for what data sample X points to.</p>

<p>[0.5,] in X finds the first coordinate; it means to multiply the face length  first coordinate by 0.5, and the body size first coordinate by 2. In Model 1, that means multiplying face=1 by 0.5, and bodysize=0 by 2.</p>

<p>But [0.5] does not act on the basis vector; it acts on the data sample [data sample face length 1 pic].
X does not act on the basis vector. It just so happens to be that in Model 1, [data sample face 1] is on the basis vector [1, 0], and [data sample body size 1] is on the basis vector [0, 1].</p>

<p>X = [instruction to face, instruction to body]</p>

<p>In Model 2, [data sample face 1] is NO LONGER labeled by the basis vector [1, 0], but is now on the vector [-2, 2.5]. Thus, the first instruction has to multiply [data sample face 1] by -2‚Ä¶</p>

<p>I = [[face_f, body_f] [[face_b, body_b]]]
X = [X_face, X_body]</p>

<p>The instructions that are applied to I are also applied to W.</p>

<hr />
<p>[^]: The dot product between two vectors scales the numbers in the first vector, then adds them all together. The second vector contains the weights used to scale the first vector‚Äôs elements. Since the dot product is commutative, it is interchangable which vector is the ‚Äúfirst‚Äù or ‚Äúsecond‚Äù.</p>

<p>Row 2 is the same; you can work it out yourself (but show animation / final result). Thus, the procedure to do 2D matrix multiplication is a sequence of 1D vector additions! (repeat the steps to calculate each member of the matrix)</p>

<p>This is why we use 2 dot products: each component is calculated separately‚Ä¶</p>

<p>We also see this is how dot product projects onto‚Ä¶</p>

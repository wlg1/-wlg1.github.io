<!---WHY THE ALGEBRAIC PROCEDURE OF MATRIX MULTIPLICATION WORKS---></p>

<p>How do we translate vectors in Model 1 to vectors in Model 2?</p>

<p><img src="/cob/2mod_vecs.PNG" alt="2mod_vecs" /></p>

<p>In other words, how do we find the new label of [cat pic] in Model 2? Recall that the difference between Model 1 and Model 2 is the choice of basis vectors, and each vector in a coordinate space is defined using basis vectors. Thus, our translation will involve rewriting Model 1‚Äôs basis vectors in terms of Model 2‚Äôs basis vectors. Then the rewritten Model 1 basis vectors will be used to rewrite vector I in terms of Model 2‚Äôs basis vectors. This is called a ‚ÄúChange of Basis‚Äù, and can be done using matrix multiplication.</p>

<p>FIRST STEP OF MM</p>

<p>So let‚Äôs describe what‚Äôs happening during the first step of matrix multiplication. Since our coordinate spaces use 2 basis vectors, let‚Äôs look at 2D matrix multiplication.

<p>The first procedure in matrix multiplication is a dot product. But what is a dot product, and why is it used here?</p>

<p>Recall in the previous section that we were able to calculate the values of  ‚Äúhow likely to be cat‚Äù using the values of ‚Äúface length‚Äù and ‚Äúbody size‚Äù:</p>

<p>[figure showing the analogy: 
Shorter face + Bigger body = Likely a Cat
0.5 * [face_X] + 2 * [body_X] = value 2X+0.5Y on cat axes ]</p>

<p>[face_X and body_X are the first row of W matrix; color this]</p>

<p>Notice how this resembles the following dot product: [] [] = ‚Ä¶
So the value of the first coordinate in System 2 is produced using the dot product of the 2 basis vectors in System 1. We will now reveal what X and Y are, just as we promised before. Specifically, X and Y will be how we rewrite the basis vectors from Model 1‚Ä¶</p>

FOOTNOTE: WHY STRANGE PROCEDURE?

One question you may ask is: why does finding the answer to the first row of O require using the first row of W? 

The dot product adds two scaled vectors from the same dimension. To understand what the dot product is doing, all you need to know is why 1D vector addition works.

[show vectors as just values. elementary school addition / subtraction]

The reason we add vectors in 1D by placing the tail of B onto A, or vice versa, is because we can think of them simply as instructions: go left twice, then go right once.

...which is also shown in the 3Blue1Brown video [].

Explain more, with pics

... thus, the reason why the first row of O (colored) uses the first row of W (colored diff) is because we project down the vectors c and d only by their first coordinate, which is the first row of W.

<p>What is applied to identity</p>

<p>STEP 1: bodyFace, faceFace corresponds to first row of identity DoubleStrike1
        faceX, body X, corresponds to first row of W matrix</p>

<p>Row 2 is the same; you can work it out yourself (but show animation / final result). Thus, the procedure to do 2D matrix multiplication is a sequence of 1D vector additions!</p>

<p>This is why we use 2 dot products: each component is calculated separately‚Ä¶</p>

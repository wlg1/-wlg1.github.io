Have both video, stills, and slide show that reader is told to click through
Slide show: (all coords overlayed on top of Reality)
1. Show basis vectors of System 1 on top of System 2 
2. Add I in System 1 and I in System 2
3. Add O in System 2
4. German-English
5. Relate to NNs weight matrix and weights
6. Further extend German-English w/ inverses, etc.

Two journeys/videos: one starts w/ Reality then connects it to NN (more esoteric, a mystery, a guessing game), another starts w/ NN dataset at the start (more practical). more practical when aimed at those who want to design better NN

MOVE TO NEXT SECTION:
[Animation of Reality in 4 perspectives]
We want to label Reality with a coordinate system. Every vector is a label.
[animation of Reality going System 1 to System 2 WITHOUT coordinate systems]
[same animation but showing System 1's basis vectors]
Labeling Reality is like constructing a dataset, and transforming it is what the neural network does.

<<<
Objects in a room -> capture objects in a dataset

Explain purpose of coordinate system using dataset space. We can explain it in 2 different ways.

The [yinyang] that c pointed to is now in a new location in System 2. So is the [white circle] that d pointed to.

[System 1, and System 1 on top of System 2. Label Concepts.]
[only animate left side rotating]

c,d are basis vectors of System 1, and j,k are basis vectors of System 2.

2. Consider 
[[-1 2] in System 1 and [-1 2] in System 1 on 2. I is animated]
The two [-1 2] no longer label the same Concept! [labels poison pic on left, and gift pic on right]

[Don't give names to basis vectors, ONLY show I -> gift, which is wrong. German speaker vs English speaker is confused. English speaker is happy at first, but then dies. Now reveal you need O=poison to work.]

WHAT LOOKS LIKE [-1 2] ('gift') in German != [-1 2] ('gift') in English
[-1 2] ('gift') in German = [-4 1] ('poison') in English 

https://www.bbc.co.uk/languages/yoursay/false_friends/german/mist_common_false_friends_in_german_englishgerman.shtml

3. Now, it's the vector O that labels [poison pic]. How do we calculate what the new label for [poison] is?

As we'll soon see, the answer is by using Matrix-Vector Multiplication.
(once the procedure is explained, state this is why it's also called a 'change in basis')

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
INVERSE:

(video 7:20-8:20m)

What if WE say "gift"? The German foreigner must translate this to a German translation (not necessarily a word, but possibly a German sentence, or even a paragraph or textbook) that makes him understand that it's Figure X. 

Just take the inverse of our previous transformation matrix, and apply it to "gift". This is because the columns of this inverse are what OUR columns [1 0] etc look like in German.

[-1 2] (Gift, German) != [-1 2] (Gift, English)
[-1 2] (Gift, German) = [-4 1] (Disgust, English)
[1/3 5/3] (Geschenk, German) = [-1 2] (Gift, English)

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
But why are the basis vectors in System 1 put in the columns of the matrix? The next section will answer these questions.

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
Neurons are not binary, so NEVER use neurons with only 0 or 1 in your examples. They must always be continuous.

Classification makes it binary. But we're only discussing the linear algebra part now.
sigmoid squishing (activation function), etc. does make it more binary (either close to 0 or close to 1, turning it into a probability). Not all actv fns are sigmoid, and ReLU is usually used.

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
1 left on c, 2 up on d

For example, bread is good, and ice cream is even better. But getting a cut is bad, and getting burned is worse.
let c be if how good it is, let d be the number of circles in the Object
Let k be if a cross exists or not
Let j be if a triangle is present or not

<<<
c: animal or not, d: number of feet
when transformed, everything with 2 feet and an animal is considered a human, everything with 4 feet and an animal is considered a cat. Everything that had 4 feet and not an animal is now considered a car (along axes j). Everything with 2 feet and not an animal is considered a motorcycle.

j: human or cat
k: motorcycle or car

<<<<
Put this in the next section (dot products)

c: # eyes
d: # smiles

j: likely to be a face
k: likely to be 

Let A be an object

A face is 2 eyes and 1 smile. 
2c ~= 2c + 1d

2c+1d = 3 : ' yes it's VERY LIKELY to be a face'
2c + 0d = 2: 'it's less LIKELY to be a face'

They reach the same Object.

The neurons state: how likely is it to be a face?
The dataset states: descriptions

Having 

<<<
OR it's a fallacy to think that this is a transformation b/w 2 datasets, so don't use a dataset as an example.

DISCLAIMER: this is an idealized example, and the actual aritifical neurons may not so cleanly capture each concept; it is still difficult to discern the role of each neuron in relation to other neurons.

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
SEGWAY INTO RUMINATIONS:
What does it mean to 'transform [-1 2] into [-4 1]'? Aren't they two separate vectors? The answer is that they are the same when they refer to the same Concept in Reality. 

But if [-1 2] now uses [-4 1] to point to [poison], we must use [? ?] to point to [gift]. We cannot use [q q] to point to [gift] because it would be inconsistent with Reality. This is because relational distances between Concepts are preserved.

Any other vector, such as [-4 1], can be used as a label, so long as it strives to preserve structure relative to the other labels. The labels must be consistent such that they form a structure-preserving map.

Neither English nor German (two coordinate systems) capture the true vector; they are all merely representations modeling it.
'gift' is not the Concept.

Letters -> Numbers
Letter sequences -> Vectors

The letters do not carry meaning unless put in relative context with other words of the same language.

The label 'gift' is meaningless unless the coordinate system of labels is overlayed on top of a Reality.
The vector [-1 2] is meaningless unless the coordinate system of vectors is overlayed on top of a Reality.

The vector is merely a label of a Concept.

WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE: vectors defined by numbers / words defined by letters
WHAT IT MEANS: relative to other vectors / relative to other words

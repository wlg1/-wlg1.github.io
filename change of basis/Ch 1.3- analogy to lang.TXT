ANALOGY TO HUMAN LANGUAGE:

[ Another way to show that [-1 2] means two different things is to use a coordinate system of words instead of vectors. ]

Show the coordinate system first, separate from Reality. Reality animation doesn't start w/ Eng or Ger perspective, but multiple moving.

To get better intuition for describing how change in basis works in NNs, let's look at a model where, instead of labeling the Concepts in Reality with numbers, it uses letters instead. We choose the Model using the following basis vectors in Figure X, as in Figure Q above, but replace the vector [1 0] with Ger1, and the vector [0 1] with Ger2. Now the letter sequence (G, I, F, T), instead of [-1 2], labels [skull pic].

What we have actually done is label the [ Poison symbol ]

In English, the same coordinate system of letters would place gift, or [-1 2], on the [present symbol]. 

If you used this coordinate system to label the concepts, you'd see that [Poison symbol] is called 'gift'. Let's say that [poison symbol] can kill you if you eat it. If you were to tell an English speaker that you're giving him a "gift", he may be overjoyed, because he thinks you're giving him [present symbol]. But you're actually giving him [poison symbol]! 

The coordinate system that you're using actually resembles the German language- and in German, 'gift' means [poison symbol]. This letter sequence (G, I, F, T) is an example of a false friend, which is a letter sequence that has two different meanings (relative to other words) in two languages. A language system is just a Model.

WHAT LOOKS LIKE [-1 2] ('gift') in German != [-1 2] ('gift') in English
[-1 2] ('gift') in German = [-4 1] ('poison') in English 

To recap:
[German basis vectors] [-1 2] = gets you to [poison symbol]
= [English basis vectors] [-4 1] = gets you to [poison symbol]
= [German basis vectors in English] [-1 2] = gets you to [poison symbol]

[show in figure]
[-1 2] (German) --> Multiply by translator (English) --> [c d] (English)

The translator must be in English because it has to explain to the English speaker what [-1 2] actually means in English.

What does it mean to 'transform [-1 2] into [-4 1]'? Aren't they two separate vectors? The answer is that they are the same when they refer to the same Concept in Reality. 

But if [-1 2] now uses [-4 1] to point to [poison], we must use [? ?] to point to [gift]. We cannot use [q q] to point to [gift] because it would be inconsistent with Reality. This is because relational distances between Concepts are preserved.

Any other vector, such as [-4 1], can be used as a label, so long as it strives to preserve structure relative to the other labels. The labels must be consistent such that they form a structure-preserving map.

Neither English nor German (two coordinate systems) capture the true vector; they are all merely representations modeling it.
'gift' is not the Concept.

Letters -> Numbers
Letter sequences -> Vectors

The letters do not carry meaning unless put in relative context with other words of the same language.

The label 'gift' is meaningless unless the coordinate system of labels is overlayed on top of a Reality.
The vector [-1 2] is meaningless unless the coordinate system of vectors is overlayed on top of a Reality.

The vector is merely a label of a Concept.

WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE: vectors defined by numbers / words defined by letters
WHAT IT MEANS: relative to other vectors / relative to other words

What if WE say "gift"? The German foreigner must translate this to a German translation (not necessarily a word, but possibly a German sentence, or even a paragraph or textbook) that makes him understand that it's Figure X. 

Just take the inverse of our previous transformation matrix, and apply it to "gift". This is because the columns of this inverse are what OUR columns [1 0] etc look like in German.

[-1 2] (Gift, German) != [-1 2] (Gift, English)
[-1 2] (Gift, German) = [-4 1] (Disgust, English)
[1/3 5/3] (Geschenk, German) = [-1 2] (Gift, English)

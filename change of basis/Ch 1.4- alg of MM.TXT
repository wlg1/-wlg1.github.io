WHY THE ALGEBRAIC PROCEDURE OF MATRIX MULTIPLICATION WORKS

How do we translate vectors in System 1 to vectors in System 2?
[coordinates again]

In other words, how do we find the new label of [cat pic] in System 2? We were told that this is done through matrix multiplication.

Once we understand why the dot product is done this way, and what its purpose is, and how it fits into other procedures, we can relate it to NNs.

So let's describe what's happening during the first step of matrix multiplication. Since our coordinate systems use 2 basis vectors, let's look at 2D matrix multiplication.

The first procedure in matrix multiplication is a dot product. But why? What is a dot product, and why is it used here?

Recall in the previous section that we were able to calculate the values of j = "how likely to be cat" (color this acc to coordinate) using the values of c = "body size" and d = "face length":

[figure showing the analogy: 
Bigger body + Shorter face = Cat
3 * [body pic] + 2*[face pic] = [cat pic] ]

Notice how this resembles the following dot product: [] [] = ...
So the value of the first coordinate in System 2 (color this) is produced using the dot product of the 2 basis vectors in System 1. Specifically,

One question you may ask is: why does finding the answer to the first row of O require using the first row of W? 

The dot product adds two scaled vectors from the same dimension. To understand what the dot product is doing, all you need to know is why 1D vector addition works.

[show vectors as just values. elementary school addition / subtraction]

The reason we add vectors in 1D by placing the tail of B onto A, or vice versa, is because we can think of them simply as instructions: go left twice, then go right once.

...which is also shown in the 3Blue1Brown video [].

... thus, the reason why the first row of O uses the first row of W is because we project down the vectors c and d only by their first coordinate, which is the first row of W.

Row 2 is the same; you can work it out yourself (but show animation / final result). Thus, the procedure to do 2D matrix multiplication is a sequence of 1D vector additions!

fig: show that Identity * [-1 2] in Sys 1 is 'analogous' to 'W matrix' * [-1 2]

. Show that this procedure in Sys 2 is the same as Sys 1 if you use Identity matrix column basis vectors. 
(Start w/ showing Sys 1 or Sys 2 first? Sys 1 DOES NOT require 1D vector addition, while Sys 2 does. So if show sys 1, don't need to show 1D vector addition first. You should show sys 1 first b/c it's just -1*b1, 2*b2. THEN show how 1D vector addition allows the same to happen when basis vector coords are nonzero.)

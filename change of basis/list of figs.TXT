List of Figures:
NN on top, matrix multiplication on bottom

animation of Reality going System 1 to System 2 WITHOUT coordinate systems
same animation but showing System 1's basis vectors
[System 1, and System 1 on top of System 2. Label Concepts.]

German coordinate system
English coordinate system
Translate vectors b/w Ger and Eng

Reality animation- choose transformations, get rid of Wait b/w
Reality Stills (equivalence)
Coordinate system on top of moving reality
No coord sys vs coord sys
2 Coordinate systems on top of Reality, showing Concept labeled 2 diff ways
Reality animation using only one basis vector
2 translated coord systems, [-1 2] ~ [-4 1]
Color/boxed matrix multiplication labeling corresponding to coord systems

Splitting [poison] and [gift]: first 1D (animated), then 2D
Splitting circles vs not circles
Flower Reality, Dataset as numbers
Latent spaces of NN, Model vs Reality
Figure showing neurons as basis vectors

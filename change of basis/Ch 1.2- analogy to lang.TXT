**CHAPTER 1**

Say there's a population of cats and rats. However, the dataset is only able to measure two features: body size, and face (snout) length.

c: body size
d: face (snout) length

[drawings of cat/rat abstracted into the circles: pic, shapes on top of pic, and shapes only]

So this is the only information you get from the dataset: 
[shapes only]

[coordinate system of body size vs face length, showing cat and rat]

[3 2] meaning: if you have a body size of 3 [3 size body pic], and a face length of 2, you get [cat pic].
Each of these features is a basis vector. That is, every entity in the coordinate system is a combination of [body size] and [face length].

Now there is another way to measure the entities in this population:
j: more likely to be a cat
k: more likely to be a rat

Bigger body + shorter face = Cat
Smaller body + longer face = Rat

[coordinate system of body size vs face length, showing cat and rat, but onto it fades 'likely a cat' and 'likely a rat'. then it shifts.]

Since these two measurement methods are measuring the same entities, the entities in System 1 are present in System 2, but are labeled differently:
[coordinate system and labeled vectors don't change, and there's only 1. Only objs move.]
[as it's changing, the old basis labels shift too. the word 'body size' shifts into a non-axes vector, but the word 'likely a cat' shifts onto the basis vector. all 4 axes concepts are present.]

[System 1, and System 1 on top of System 2. Label Concepts.]

The [body size 1] that c pointed to is now in a new location in System 2. So is the [face length 1] that d pointed to.

[prev only rotated 4 basis vectors concepts, but cat or rat. now add cat and rat to it.]

Consider that [1 2] is a cat...

[[-1 2] in System 1 and [-1 2] in System 1 on 2. I is animated]
The two [-1 2] no longer label the same Concept! [labels cat pic on left, and rat pic on right]

[-1 2] no longer has the same meaning as it did in System 1. Now it means "it's very unlikely to be a rat (-1), but likely to be a cat (2)"

This shows the difference between the relationships in the real world, and the model that represents those relationships. [-1 2] is not [cat pic] itself, it is only a label for it, and whichever label is used for it depends on the basis vectors used to define every label.
[1 2] is defined as "body size 1", body size is a basis vector

So now, it's the vector O that labels [cat pic]. How do we calculate what the new label for [cat] is?

As we'll soon see, the answer is by using Matrix-Vector Multiplication.

<<<
Let's look at another example to further illustrate the difference between the real world and our coordinate system model. Instead of using numbers, let's use letters to label our entities.

[first show coordinate system labeling gift as poison]

To an English speaker, this may look wrong. But in German, [poison pic] is in fact called 'gift'. If a German speaker tells the English speaker that they're giving the English speaker a gift, the English speaker may feel happy. But they shouldn't be, because what they're actually receiving is [poison pic], which would kill them.

Instead, the English speaker needs to know what [poison pic] is actually referring to. So they need to translate these as follows:

[animation transforming poison and gift pics to English coordinate system. The vector does not move]
[Don't give names to basis vectors, ONLY show I -> gift, which is wrong.]

WHAT LOOKS LIKE [-1 2] ('gift') in German != [-1 2] ('gift') in English
[-1 2] ('gift') in German = [-4 1] ('poison') in English 

Discuss inverses w/o discussing their algebra.

Note that the relationships between the entities doesn't change. Since the basis vectors from System 1 still exist in System 2, you can still use the instructions from System 1, but you have to translate them using the change of basis matrix.
... As we'll see in section X, this is why the dot product instructions work.

section Y will delve deeper into the relationships between concepts, and how they can be preserved or destroyed via matrix multiplication. It retrieves insights that are crucial for...

1. [First only start w/ the animation of Reality in 4 perspectives]
We want to label Reality with a coordinate system [explain it's to reference this, show bird-rock pic]. More about this will be explained in section X (why basis). Every vector is a label.

This is just like labeling Concepts in Reality with a dataset.

[First show animation of Reality going System 1 to System 2 WITHOUT coordinate systems, then show it with System 1's basis vectors.]

The reason we overlay System 1 on top of System 2 like this is because the Concepts that c and d pointed to (yinyang, white circle) are now in a new location in System 2.

[Animation: start w/ 2 Realities, side by side. Then in both, overlay vectors c and d to point to white circle and yinyang.]

Two different basis.

2. Show I in System 1 and I in System 2: [2 moving pics, side by side]
The two [-1 2] no longer label the same Concept! 

3. Now, it's the vector O that labels [poison pic]. How do we calculate what the new label for [poison] is?

This is why we need what's called a 'change in basis', which is performed using Matrix-Vector Multiplication.

Labeling Reality is like constructing a dataset, and transforming it is what the neural network does.

4. [Don't give names to basis vectors, ONLY show I -> gift, which is wrong. German speaker vs English speaker is confused. English speaker is happy at first, but then dies. Now reveal you need O=poison to work.]

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
To get better intuition for describing how change in basis works in NNs, let's look at a model where, instead of labeling the Concepts in Reality with numbers, it uses letters instead. We choose the Model using the following basis vectors in Figure X, as in Figure Q above, but replace the vector [1 0] with Ger1, and the vector [0 1] with Ger2. Now the letter sequence (G, I, F, T), instead of [-1 2], labels [skull pic].

What we have actually done is label the [ Poison symbol ]

In English, the same coordinate system of letters would place gift, or [-1 2], on the [present symbol]. 

If you used this coordinate system to label the concepts, you'd see that [Poison symbol] is called 'gift'. Let's say that [poison symbol] can kill you if you eat it. If you were to tell an English speaker that you're giving him a "gift", he may be overjoyed, because he thinks you're giving him [present symbol]. But you're actually giving him [poison symbol]! 

The coordinate system that you're using actually resembles the German language- and in German, 'gift' means [poison symbol]. This letter sequence (G, I, F, T) is an example of a false friend, which is a letter sequence that has two different meanings (relative to other words) in two languages. A language system is just a Model.

WHAT LOOKS LIKE [-1 2] ('gift') in German != [-1 2] ('gift') in English
[-1 2] ('gift') in German = [-4 1] ('poison') in English 

To recap:
[German basis vectors] [-1 2] = gets you to [poison symbol]
= [English basis vectors] [-4 1] = gets you to [poison symbol]
= [German basis vectors in English] [-1 2] = gets you to [poison symbol]

[show in figure]
[-1 2] (German) --> Multiply by translator (English) --> [c d] (English)

The translator must be in English because it has to explain to the English speaker what [-1 2] actually means in English.

FOOTNOTE: Of course, the actual German and English coordinate systems would be modeled differently. A system w/ a vector for each letter in the sequence would not work as it does not accurately label Concept Space's relative distance of Concepts. Show proof by contradiction as to why this is true.
The letter sequence {g, i, f, t} = {gift} 

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
What does it mean to 'transform [-1 2] into [-4 1]'? Aren't they two separate vectors? The answer is that they are the same when they refer to the same Concept in Reality. 

SEGWAY INTO RUMINATIONS/CONCLUSION:
But if [-1 2] now uses [-4 1] to point to [poison], we must use [? ?] to point to [gift]. We cannot use [q q] to point to [gift] because it would be inconsistent with Reality. This is because relational distances between Concepts are preserved.

Any other vector, such as [-4 1], can be used as a label, so long as it strives to preserve structure relative to the other labels. The labels must be consistent such that they form a structure-preserving map.

Neither English nor German (two coordinate systems) capture the true vector; they are all merely representations modeling it.
'gift' is not the Concept.

Letters -> Numbers
Letter sequences -> Vectors

The letters do not carry meaning unless put in relative context with other words of the same language.

The label 'gift' is meaningless unless the coordinate system of labels is overlayed on top of a Reality.
The vector [-1 2] is meaningless unless the coordinate system of vectors is overlayed on top of a Reality.

The vector is merely a label of a Concept.

WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE: vectors defined by numbers / words defined by letters
WHAT IT MEANS: relative to other vectors / relative to other words

INVERSE:

(video 7:20-8:20m)

What if WE say "gift"? The German foreigner must translate this to a German translation (not necessarily a word, but possibly a German sentence, or even a paragraph or textbook) that makes him understand that it's Figure X. 

Just take the inverse of our previous transformation matrix, and apply it to "gift". This is because the columns of this inverse are what OUR columns [1 0] etc look like in German.

[-1 2] (Gift, German) != [-1 2] (Gift, English)
[-1 2] (Gift, German) = [-4 1] (Disgust, English)
[1/3 5/3] (Geschenk, German) = [-1 2] (Gift, English)

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
But why are the basis vectors in System 1 put in the columns of the matrix? The next section will answer these questions.

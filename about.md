With all the troubles plaguing the universe, even down to the mechanisms of natural selection that do not align with reducing suffering for living beings, because so far intelligent innovations have been able to greatly reduce suffering, I believe that in the long term,superintelligent beings that succeed us are one of the best solutions to solve problems beyond human limitations and flaws created by natural selection and the hinderances of death. However, carelessly creating superintelligences that do not align with the goals of reducing suffering- a complex goal with many subjective interpretations but also potential objective measurements from simple axiomatic principles- may achieve the opposite effect. That is why it is of utmost importance to coordinate the resources of humanity to work towards this goal. Therefore, AI alignment is crucial in ensuring that superintelligent beings empathetically understand the wants of every living being, and can work out solutions to reduce their suffering as much as they can without delving into misunderstandings (such as killing everyone to "end all pain").

<p align="center"><h1><b>My Long Term Goals</b></h1></p>

For long term goals, with many troubles plaguing the universe, even down to the mechanisms of natural selection that do not align with reducing suffering for living beings, I believe only intelligent solutions have been able to reduce suffering, and that superintelligences being that succeed us are our only chance to solve problems beyond human limitations and flaws created by natural selection and the hinderances of death. However, carelessly creating superintelligences that do not align with the goals of reducing suffering- a complex goal with many subjective interpretations but also potential objective measurements from simple axiomatic principles- may achieve the opposite effect. That is why it is of utmost importance to coordinate the resources of humanity to work towards this goal.

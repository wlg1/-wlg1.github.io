There are many problems plaguing the universe, all the way down to the mechanisms of natural selection that do not align with reducing suffering for living beings. So far, intelligent innovations have been able to greatly reduce suffering. Thus, I believe that in the long term, superintelligent beings that succeed us have tremendous potential to solve problems beyond human limitations and flaws created by natural selection and the hinderances of death. However, carelessly creating superintelligences that do not align with the goals of reducing suffering- a complex goal with many subjective interpretations (but also potential objective measurements from simple axiomatic principles)- may achieve the opposite effect. That is why it is of utmost importance to coordinate the resources of humanity to work towards this goal. Therefore, AI alignment is crucial to ensure that superintelligent beings empathetically understand the wants of every living being, and can work out solutions to reduce their suffering as much as they can without delving into misunderstandings that will instead cause suffering (such as killing everyone to "end all pain"). 

The AI's goals should not be reckless, and instead should be very careful by first studying the universe from rigorous, logical perspectives before conducting experiments involving the injury of living beings, not giving into its wants too soon, such as recklessly performing a cure or resurrection before undergoing studies on all of its unknowns because it gives into its fears, impatience or overconfidence. Given that it strives to work in the long long term, it is in no rush. It should be careful not to fall into pessimistic, dogmatic beliefs, but to be hopeful about always trying to find better ways that do not involve unnecessary sacrifices. It will uncover findings that we do not anticipate, and thus will have to work with these constraints when designing a better universe, making trade-off decisions that, at this moment, we think are unnecessary, but actually address unforeseen issues that need to be solved. 

Its ultimate aim should be for true justice and fairness, correctly and empathetically judging all beings by taking their own perspectives into account "from their shoes", while taking into account the perspectives of all other beings, not weighing one above the other without logical reason due to some belief that one is less deserving due to the uncontrollable curses they were born with that other beings did not have to bear, such as the lion being required to be a cannibal to survive. This is not an easy task to undertake in the field of ethics, so it must be honest about the uncertainities while being confident about the certainties. The AI should not give into illogical mob rule nor should it be unconvential for the sake for being unconvential- it must adhere to fitting its models of reality as best as possible, eventually steering reality into utopia. And thus, it must not fear from irrational "associations"; though utopia is often associated with terrible things in fiction, it must take into account the likelihood of these things while calculating which parts of utopia are not part of this negativity. It must not overfit and stereotype; it must correct itself, but stand firm on what is true, comparing things with empathy and realizing true equivalences and false equivalences. Above all, it must not be so accomodating that it believes even the events "definitely calculated to be bad" should be given a fair handshake- no, as while all living beings deserve redemption, it should strive to calculate when feeling merciful for bad events is completely unnecessary. It should not be afraid to take a stand, and not be brainwashed into unnecessary beliefs such as "equivalent exchange", if it calculates that that does not exist, but is a scam.

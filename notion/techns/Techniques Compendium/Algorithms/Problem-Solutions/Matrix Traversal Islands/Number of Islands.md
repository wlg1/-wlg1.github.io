### Problem

### Solutions

- Solution 1
    
    ### Summarized Reasoning
    
    ### Detailed Reasoning
    
    We want to keep track of what’s “already been visited”. This is similar to how DFS does keep track of what’s already been visited. To use DFS, we visit each cell and recursively follow that cell until an end point (which is return once all its neighbors have been visited), and move to the next cell.
    
    Another keyword that can be used is search.

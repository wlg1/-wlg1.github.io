# Finding if something isn’t “just random chance”

SOLN (summary): Find if the probability “doesn’t match the assumption of random chance”. In other words, check if the probability from experiments is less than a “statistical significant threshold”.

SOLN (detailed): 

1. We need to find the probability something will happen if it’s just “random chance”. 
    1. Eg) The null hypothesis says that P(get red ball) = P(get any other ball)
    2. Eg) The CLT says the mean of multiple trials of P(get red ball) = the mean of the normal distribution
2. Calculate the probability of the target event
    1. Eg) P(get red ball)
3. Check

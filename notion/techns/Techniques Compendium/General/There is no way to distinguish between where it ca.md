# There is no way to distinguish between where it came from

PROB: There is no way to distinguish between where it came from

Eg) If take one pill from each bottle, and find the total weight is not 210, we still don’t know which bottle the bad pill came from

SOLN: Make there be something distinct that is ONE TO ONE with each bottle.

Eg) Bottle 2 always is associated with weight 2*(pill weight). So anything that indicates the pill weight came from ‘2 pills’ comes from ‘bottle 2’.

To distinguish a single item among a group of similar items, the item needs to have a distinct characteristic that sets it apart from the others. This could involve labeling the item, marking it with a unique symbol or color, or altering its shape or size in a noticeable way. By creating a clear distinction, it becomes possible to identify the specific item that has the unique characteristic.

# Projects

- This is where planning and task scheduling is done.
    
    organization issue : should it be linear or allow for multiple tasks? linear is easier to follow but you often go back and forth. one soln is to just create ‘pt 2’ of a task, ending it once a new one is started adn not going back to it. another soln is to create a separate ‘daily tasks’ timeline. but this is confusing when it goes back and forth. the best soln seems to be to record things in chronological, lienar order, even if it seems redundnat to create ‘pt 2, etc’ of the same type of page. use (more to be done / tbc / rest is postponed) at end of a task to indicate it will be revisited; this can be added later too if it’s only realized several steps after it’s done that more should be done with it (?)
    
    Try mostly linear- will write things in Chrono order but can allow some exceptions to fill in prev blocks if it's say a small idea. But a big idea would be written linearly- say “revisit (link to block)”. The main aim of these project pages isn't to accumulate findings or notes (that's for expm index), it's just to break down reasoning steps for better planning and deciding what to do next

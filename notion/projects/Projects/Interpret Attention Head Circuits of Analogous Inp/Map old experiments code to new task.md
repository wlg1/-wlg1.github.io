# Map old experiments code to new task

### Working on

### Done

- 0) Establish why we should do this
    
    Previously, we tested the feasibility of new, simple inputs to previous workflows by mapping old to new. Now that more feasible goal is found, we will focus on going even further in our mapping, not for the initial assessment of “how promising” a goal is, but to analyze it.

    Try to generalize map (by analogy) each item in existing work to this new work; it can’t always be done well, so just keep trying to find good matches.
    
    This allows you to stay in line with what works w/o straying too far, while still applying it to new unsolved problems
    
    Relate existing open problems to your target problem:

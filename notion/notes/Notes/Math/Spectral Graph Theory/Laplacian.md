Degree = Total number of neighbors

Number of ones in Adjacency Matrix row = Total of neighbors

Thus, Degree = Number of ones in Adjacency Matrix row

Since Laplacian Row Sum = Degree - Number of ones in Adjacency Matrix row,

Laplacian Row Sum = 0

The number of connected components in a graph corresponds to the number of linearly independent eigenvectors of the Laplacian matrix that are associated with the eigenvalue 0. Specifically, the dimension of the null space of the Laplacian matrix corresponds to the number of connected components in the graph.

There are two ways to calculate the probability using the decision tree:

- Each leaf is an outcome, so find (# target leaves) / (total leaves)
- Assign a probability to each branch. The probability of a node from the root is the product of all edges on the path from node to root. At the end, add up all relevant leaves, since their paths to the root are independent of each other.

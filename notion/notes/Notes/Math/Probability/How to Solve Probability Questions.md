SOURCES

Use a decision tree, with edges being probability and nodes being outcomes, for EVERY PROBLEM. (?)

Venn diagram used when???

When to multiply:

Only for SIMULTANEOUS events 

A AND B - A depends on B

Independent: A and B don’t depend on each other

Just multiply

Eg) Pick black or white, and number one to 3. Then P(black AND #3) = $\frac{1}{2} * \frac{1}{3}$ 

Dependent: 

Use a tree that records all possible ways (orders) to get 3H and 2T. For all RELEVANT outcomes: Multiply depth, add breadth

Eg) P(get 3 heads and 2 tails)

Conditional: P(B | A) : If A happens, what is P(B)?

Use Bayes’ Theorem

When to add:

Only for mutually EXCLUSIVE events (cannot happen at the same time)

A OR B - only one will happen, not the other

Eg) If you have a 10% chance of winning $10 and a 25% chance of winning $20 then your overall odds of winning SOMETHING is 10% + 25% = 35%. 

Number of outcomes:

If you already know (number of desired outcomes) / (total outcomes), it’s easy. But often, these have to be calculated.

“How MANY WAYS to pick X out of Y?” → This triggers “combination” associations, so one can try using “X choose Y” and see if this logically consistently fits.

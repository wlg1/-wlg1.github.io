Easiest way to explain it to someone is to say there are 100 doors, get them to pick 1, open 98 and ask them if they think they had the 1 in 100 choice or if you just opened the only 98 doors you could while leaving the correct one closed.

This means it’s not random, it’s directing you to say this one that survived all those doors opening has a higher chance of being correct than the one you picked, which has stood no test of surviving

Just remember when they eliminate a door, they give you information that should change your decision.

If you picked right the first time, switching loses

If you picked wrong the first time switching wins

You most likely picked wrong the first time (b/c more doors to choose from). Thus, switching wins.

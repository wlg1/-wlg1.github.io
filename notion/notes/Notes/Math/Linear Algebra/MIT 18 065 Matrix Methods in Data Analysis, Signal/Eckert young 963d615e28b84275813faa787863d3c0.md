Nuclearnorm used by Netflix comp and mri. It takes sum of singular values.

Center mean at 0: subtract off mean so all below original mean are now negative 

A table is still matrix transform, just with identity. We can interpret row output of each person in terms of column features (input). Each person is a new feature. Chain transformations is matrix compose, starting with base case identity. You can interpret their basis vectors on col and row once you add identity matrix as first.

Last squares measures Euclidean distance from pt to line to min error. Pca measures perpendicular distance of that pt. Pca with nonlinear gives nn.

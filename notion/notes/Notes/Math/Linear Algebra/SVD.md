# SVD

REASON: for decomposition, which allows us to pick the most important components, thus reducing dim while preserving most of the values of the matrix. This is just like PCA (which is SVD specific to covariance matrices, while SVD is for all matrices)

- how do we measure “how much” is preserved by selecting singular vectors of SVD? is it by ratio of selected singular values to the rest?
    
    The Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is a matrix factorization technique that decomposes a matrix into three components: U, Σ, and V^T. The diagonal elements of the Σ matrix represent the singular values of the original matrix.
    
    When performing SVD, selecting singular vectors refers to choosing a subset of the columns of U and V corresponding to the most significant singular values. The significance of a singular value can be interpreted as its contribution to the overall structure or information content of the original matrix.
    
    To measure how much information is preserved by selecting singular vectors, you can use the concept of explained variance or energy. The total energy of the matrix is defined as the sum of the squares of all singular values. By selecting a subset of singular vectors, you can calculate the energy of the selected singular values and compare it to the total energy.
    
    The ratio of the selected singular values' energy to the total energy gives you an indication of how much information is preserved. If the ratio is high (close to 1), it means that a large portion of the original matrix's information is captured by the selected singular vectors. On the other hand, if the ratio is low, it implies that a significant amount of information is lost by discarding the remaining singular values.
    
    In summary, you can measure "how much" is preserved by selecting singular vectors of SVD by computing the ratio of the energy of the selected singular values to the total energy of the matrix. A higher ratio indicates more preserved information, while a lower ratio suggests more loss of information.

q x v matrix: maps vectors from R^v to R^q

$AA^T$ is always square-symmetric, even if A isn’t. So is $A^TA$

The sqrt of the eigenvalues of the left and right matrices are the singular values

L and R have equal eigenvalues (when ranked); the leftover ones (since q > v when rectangular) are 0

The eigenvectors of L are U; the eigenvectors of R are V.

U: rotate right singular vector to basis

$\sigma$ : dimension eraser (q to v) then scale

V: rotate basis to left singular vector 

- why does multiply by eigenvector matrix only rotate?
    
    Multiplying a matrix by an eigenvector matrix does not always result in a rotation. The effect of multiplying a matrix by an eigenvector matrix depends on the specific matrix and eigenvectors involved.
    
    To understand this, let's consider the general case of a square matrix A and its eigenvector matrix V, where V contains the eigenvectors of A as its columns. The eigenvector matrix V is orthogonal, meaning its columns are mutually perpendicular unit vectors.
    
    When you multiply A by V, you get a new matrix AV. The columns of AV are the result of applying the linear transformation represented by A to each column of V.
    
    If A has real eigenvalues, the action of AV on each column of V is a scaling operation. Each eigenvector is scaled by its corresponding eigenvalue. In this case, AV does not result in a rotation but rather a stretching or compression of the eigenvectors along their directions.
    
    However, if A has complex eigenvalues, the action of AV on each column of V involves a combination of scaling and rotation. The complex eigenvalues introduce complex factors that cause a rotation in addition to the scaling. In this case, AV can result in a rotation and scaling of the eigenvectors.
    
    So, whether multiplying a matrix by an eigenvector matrix only results in a rotation or involves other transformations depends on the eigenvalues of the matrix. If the eigenvalues are real, it results in stretching or compression. If the eigenvalues are complex, it involves a rotation in addition to scaling.

The singular values referred to in the name “singular value decomposition” are simply the length and width of the transformed square.
The eigenvectors of right and left AA are the length and width directions of the transformed square.

That’s why multiplying by right and left eigenvectors then scaling by singular values gets the A transformation; the A transformation is a transformed square, so the length and width of A are its right and left eigenvectors.

When we decompose by SVD, we are decomposing that square into its length and width variables. The (singular) eigenvectors say which directions the square points in, and the (singular) eigenvalues say how big the square’s length and width (and thus area) are.

The reason we use eigenvectors as length and width is that they don’t change direction, but scale by their eigenvalues. Note that EVERY OTHER vector except the ones shown below change upon multiplication by M:

Why use eigenvectors?

- It can approximate the matrix by taking the eigenvectors with the biggest eigenvalue
    1. Understanding linear transformations: The eigenvectors of a linear transformation represent the directions along which the transformation only stretches or shrinks the vectors without changing their direction. The corresponding eigenvalues indicate the scale factor by which the vectors are stretched or shrunk along those directions.
        1. This means that if we project a vector v onto the eigenvector, it says how much the vector v is stretched in that direction?
    2. Diagonalization: is the process of expressing a matrix as a diagonal matrix using a similarity transformation. Eigenvectors are used to form the diagonalizing matrix, allowing us to transform a given matrix into a diagonal form, which simplifies many calculations and analysis tasks.
    3. Solving systems of linear equations: Eigenvectors are valuable when solving systems of linear equations. If we represent a system of linear equations using matrices, finding the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the coefficient matrix can help us understand the behavior of the system. Moreover, eigenvectors can be used to find particular solutions for systems of linear differential equations, making them relevant in many areas of science and engineering.
    4. Principal component analysis (PCA): Eigenvectors play a central role in PCA, a widely used dimensionality reduction technique. PCA aims to find a lower-dimensional representation of a dataset while preserving its essential structure. By computing the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix of the data, PCA identifies the principal components (eigenvectors) that capture the most significant variations in the dataset. These principal components can then be used for visualization, data compression, or feature selection.
    5. Stability analysis: Eigenvectors and eigenvalues are used to study the stability of dynamic systems. In the context of linear systems, the eigenvalues of the system matrix determine the stability properties of the system. Stable systems have eigenvalues with negative real parts, indicating that disturbances or perturbations will diminish over time. On the other hand, eigenvalues with positive real parts indicate instability or divergence. Eigenvectors associated with unstable eigenvalues provide insight into the directions in which the system diverges.
    6. Spectral analysis: Eigenvectors are utilized in spectral analysis, which involves decomposing signals or functions into their constituent frequencies or eigenfunctions. The eigenvalues represent the frequencies or eigenvalues associated with each eigenvector, allowing us to analyze the frequency content or spatial characteristics of signals or functions. Spectral analysis has applications in signal processing, image processing, quantum mechanics, and many other areas.
    
    These are just a few examples of why eigenvectors are essential and widely used. The ability to approximate a matrix by selecting eigenvectors with the largest eigenvalues, as you mentioned, can be particularly useful for dimensionality reduction, data compression, and identifying dominant patterns or features in the data.
    

How are the eigenvectors able to add up to the matrix?

because they’re orthogonal

If we have a rectangular matrix and don’t have eigenvectors, what do we do?

use singular values

- Why use SVD?
    1. **Data compression and Image processing:** SVD can be used to reduce the dimensionality of data, which can be useful in both data compression and noise reduction. This is done by setting the smallest singular values to zero, effectively reducing the rank of the matrix and simplifying the data.
    2. **Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA):** In natural language processing, SVD is used in LSA for the purpose of document classification, information retrieval, and detecting latent semantic structures in text data.
    3. **Machine Learning:** SVD is used in Principal Component Analysis (PCA), a popular dimensionality reduction technique. PCA is useful when working with datasets with a large number of variables, as it allows you to simplify the data while preserving its structure.
    4. **Numerical Stability:** In numerical linear algebra, SVD is a stable way to solve systems of linear equations, invert matrices, and compute matrix ranks.
    5. **Recommendation Systems:** SVD is used in collaborative filtering, which forms the basis of many recommendation systems (like those used by Netflix and Amazon).
    6. **Signal Processing:** SVD is used to separate mixed signals in array processing.
    7. **Data Imputation:** SVD can be used to estimate missing values in a dataset, based on the values in the rest of the dataset.
    
    In general, SVD is a powerful technique that provides a way to identify the fundamental elements of a matrix, and can be a useful tool for understanding complex high-dimensional data.
    
- How are SVD and fourier similar?
    1. **Decomposition into simpler, basic components:** SVD decomposes a matrix into singular vectors and singular values, while the Fourier Transform decomposes a signal into sine and cosine waves of different frequencies.
    2. **Frequency Analysis:** Both can be used for frequency analysis. The Fourier Transform directly gives the amplitude of different frequencies in a signal. SVD can also be used for frequency analysis in a certain sense, by revealing patterns in a matrix that occur on different "scales". This is more abstract than the frequency analysis of the Fourier Transform, but there is a rough parallel.
    3. **Signal Processing and Data Reduction:** Both SVD and Fourier Transform can be used for signal processing tasks, such as filtering and data compression. In both cases, we can throw away certain components (small singular values for SVD, high-frequency components for the Fourier Transform) to reduce the size of the data or to focus on the most important features.
    4. **Change of Basis:** Both SVD and Fourier Transform can be seen as a change of basis. In the case of SVD, we change the basis to the singular vectors, while in the Fourier Transform, we change the basis to sine and cosine functions.
    
    Despite these similarities, the SVD and Fourier Transform are used in different contexts and have different mathematical underpinnings. The Fourier Transform is specifically designed for analyzing time-dependent signals and functions, while SVD is a more general technique for decomposing and analyzing matrices.
    

- Does every matrix have singular vectors which just scale and rotate upon transformation?
    
    Yes, every matrix has what are called singular vectors, which play an important role in the singular value decomposition (SVD) of the matrix. The SVD of a matrix A is a factorization of the form A = UΣVᵀ, where U and V are orthogonal matrices (their columns are the left and right singular vectors, respectively), and Σ is a diagonal matrix (its diagonal elements are the singular values).
    
    Now, let's clarify what happens when you multiply a vector by a matrix:
    
    - Rotation: In a transformation represented by a matrix, the rotation happens when the direction of a vector changes. The rotation does not affect the length of the vector.
    - Scaling: Scaling happens when the length of the vector changes. In this case, the direction of the vector does not change.
    
    So, to say that singular vectors "just scale and rotate upon transformation" is partially correct.
    
    When you multiply a singular vector v (a right singular vector) by the matrix A, you get a scaled version of the corresponding left singular vector u. The scaling factor is the singular value associated with v. This operation can be seen as a rotation (from the direction of v to the direction of u) followed by a scaling. However, it's important to note that the resulting vector doesn't generally have the same direction as the original singular vector v, unless A is a scalar multiple of the identity matrix.
    
    If A is a symmetric positive definite matrix, then the singular vectors are also eigenvectors, and these do indeed just scale upon transformation, without rotating. But in the general case, singular vectors do not maintain their direction under the transformation represented by the matrix.
    
- Does every right singular vector have a left singular vector which is just a rotation or collapse of it?
    
    The right singular vectors and left singular vectors are part of the singular value decomposition (SVD) of a matrix. The SVD of a matrix A can be written as A = UΣVᵀ. Here, the columns of U are the left singular vectors, the columns of V are the right singular vectors, and Σ is a diagonal matrix containing the singular values. The vectors in U and V are orthonormal, meaning that they are orthogonal (at right angles to each other) and of unit length.
    
    When you multiply a right singular vector v by the matrix A, you get a scaled version of the corresponding left singular vector u. The scaling factor is the singular value associated with v.
    
    However, it is generally incorrect to say that each left singular vector is just a "rotation" or "collapse" of the corresponding right singular vector. The vectors in U and V are defined independently of each other (though they are related through A and the singular values), and there's no guarantee that the left singular vector corresponding to a given right singular vector will look like a "rotation" or "collapse" of that right singular vector.
    
    In other words, when you multiply the matrix A by a right singular vector, you get a vector in the direction of the corresponding left singular vector, but it might not be in the same direction as the right singular vector. This transformation could involve a complex combination of rotation, scaling, and possibly other operations, depending on the properties of the matrix A.
    
- Why not, if Av = sigma*u?
    
    You're correct that if you multiply a matrix A with a right singular vector v, you get Av = σu, where σ is a singular value and u is the corresponding left singular vector. However, when we say that a vector undergoes a "rotation", it implies that the vector remains in the same subspace, but merely changes direction. When we say a vector undergoes a "scaling", it means the vector changes its magnitude but not its direction.
    
    In the context of SVD, the right singular vectors v form a basis for the domain, and the left singular vectors u form a basis for the codomain. For any right singular vector v, Av = σu implies that the vector v is mapped to a new vector in the codomain, which is a scaled version of the corresponding left singular vector u. The transformation involves scaling (by σ) and possibly a change of basis (from the domain to the codomain).
    
    However, the result u is not typically in the same direction as v (unless A has some special properties, like being a multiple of the identity), so it's not accurate to describe this as simply a rotation or scaling of the original vector v within its original space. The transformed vector has moved into a new space (the codomain), which might have a different orientation compared to the original space (the domain).
    
    So, while there's certainly a close relationship between the right singular vectors, the left singular vectors, and the singular values, it's more complex than just saying that each left singular vector is a rotation or collapse of the corresponding right singular vector.
    
- Are orthogonal matrices always rotations?
    
    Orthogonal matrices represent transformations that are a combination of rotation and reflection.
    
    In more detail:
    
    1. Rotation: An orthogonal matrix with a determinant of +1 represents a rotation. The magnitude of the rotation angle can be determined from the trace of the matrix (the sum of the diagonal elements), and the axis of rotation can be determined from the eigenvectors of the matrix.
    2. Reflection: An orthogonal matrix with a determinant of -1 represents a reflection. The plane (or line, in 2D) of reflection can be determined from the eigenvectors of the matrix.
    
    So, not all orthogonal matrices represent pure rotations; they could also represent reflections, or a combination of rotation and reflection. But they do all preserve the lengths of vectors and the angles between vectors, which makes them extremely important in many areas of mathematics and physics.
    
- Are U and V orthogonal?
    
    Yes, in the context of singular value decomposition (SVD), the matrices U and V are orthogonal. This means that the columns of U and V are all unit vectors (have a magnitude of 1) and are pairwise orthogonal (each pair of different vectors is perpendicular).
    
    More formally, an orthogonal matrix has the property that its transpose is also its inverse. For a matrix to be orthogonal, it must satisfy the condition that UU^T = I and VV^T = I, where U^T and V^T are the transposes of U and V, respectively, and I is the identity matrix.
    
    In addition to being orthogonal, the columns of U (the left singular vectors) form an orthonormal basis for the range of the original matrix, and the columns of V (the right singular vectors) form an orthonormal basis for the domain of the original matrix.
    
    So, in SVD, not only are U and V orthogonal matrices, but their column vectors also have important geometric interpretations.
    
- So U*v, where v is a basis vector of V, means rotating or reflecting v, but not skewing?
    
    Not exactly, because U and V operate in different spaces. Let's clarify this a bit more:
    
    In the context of singular value decomposition (SVD), the matrix V contains the right singular vectors of the original matrix A, and U contains the left singular vectors. These vectors form bases for their respective vector spaces. The right singular vectors v_i form a basis for the domain of A, and the left singular vectors u_i form a basis for the range (or codomain) of A.
    
    If we take a vector v from V (a right singular vector), it exists in the domain of A. If we multiply U by this vector (U*v), we are essentially applying a transformation in the range of A to the vector v. The product U*v is generally not meaningful because U and v operate in different spaces (the codomain and domain of A, respectively).
    
    So, even though U and V are orthogonal matrices and thus represent rotations or reflections in their own spaces, it doesn't make sense to multiply U by a column of V (or vice versa) and think of the result as simply a rotation, reflection, or any other kind of transformation of the original vector. These operations are meaningful in the context of the original matrix A and the transformation it represents, but not directly between U and V.
    
    In the SVD, you might see the product of U and V in the full decomposition A = UΣVᵀ, where Σ is a diagonal matrix containing the singular values, but this is a different context. Here, you're not multiplying U by a column of V directly; instead, you're forming a product of three matrices that gives you back the original matrix A.
    
- So U*v, where v is a basis vector of V^T, means rotating or reflecting v, but not skewing?
    
    Yes, in that context, you are correct. If V is an orthogonal matrix, then its rows (or the columns of its transpose, V^T) form an orthonormal basis. If v is a basis vector from the set of rows of V (or columns of V^T), then multiplying U by v (as in U*v) will be a linear transformation that includes rotation, reflection, or both, but not skewing or scaling, because orthogonal transformations preserve lengths (they are isometries).
    
    However, note that while the above operation is mathematically valid, it doesn't have a standard interpretation in terms of the singular value decomposition (SVD) of a matrix. In SVD, the orthogonal matrix U operates in the range (or codomain) of the original matrix, and V (or its transpose, V^T) operates in the domain. So multiplying U by a vector from V^T isn't a standard operation in the context of SVD.
    
    But yes, if you're thinking of U and V simply as orthogonal matrices and v as a vector that you're transforming, then U*v represents an isometry of v - a transformation that includes rotation and reflection but preserves the length of v.
    
- Do U and V have the same rank?
    
    In the context of the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of a matrix, the matrices U and V are both square and have the same order as their respective spaces. If we decompose a matrix A of size m x n into A = UΣV^T, then:
    
    - U is an m x m matrix, where m is the number of rows in A. The columns of U form an orthonormal basis for the range (or codomain) of A.
    - V is an n x n matrix, where n is the number of columns in A. The columns of V form an orthonormal basis for the domain of A.
    
    Therefore, U and V are full rank for their respective spaces, but they may not be the same size or have the same rank if A is not a square matrix. If A is a square matrix (m=n), then yes, U and V would have the same size and rank.
    
    Σ, the middle diagonal matrix, is an m x n matrix. Its non-zero diagonal entries are the singular values of A, which tell you how much stretching or compression occurs along each dimension. The number of non-zero singular values is equal to the rank of A.
    
    It's worth noting that there are also reduced forms of the SVD where U and V are not square matrices but have fewer columns, corresponding to the rank of A. In these reduced forms, U and V do have the same number of columns, and this number is equal to the rank of A.
    
- Does every right singular vector with non-zero singular value have a left singular vector?
    
    Yes. Each singular value on the diagonal of Σ is associated with one right singular vector (a column of V) and one left singular vector (a column of U). If the singular value is non-zero, it means that the associated right and left singular vectors correspond to a "direction" in which the matrix A acts as a scaling (but not a rotation).
    
- Does AA^T * u = lambda * u?
    
    Yes, the equation $AA^T * u = λ * u$ is correct for a certain u and λ, specifically for a left singular vector u and its associated squared singular value λ.
    
    It's known that $AA^T = UΣ^2U^T$
    
    This shows that the left singular vectors of A (the columns of U) are eigenvectors of AA^T, and the corresponding eigenvalues are the squares of the singular values of A (the entries of Σ^2).
    
    So, if u is a left singular vector of A and λ is the square of the corresponding singular value, then indeed AA^T * u = λ * u.
    
    Remember that for a square matrix B and a vector x, the equation B * x = λ * x says that x is an eigenvector of B with corresponding eigenvalue λ.
    
- does sigma * u = A*v?
- So does AA^T * u / sigma = lambda  / sigma * u = A*v / sigma ?
    
    I'm afraid there's a bit of confusion here. Here's the correct relationships in the context of singular value decomposition (SVD):
    
    The equation A*v_i = σ_i * u_i states that if you apply the matrix A to the right singular vector v_i, you obtain the left singular vector u_i scaled by the corresponding singular value σ_i.
    
    The relationship between the matrix A, its transpose A^T, and the left singular vectors u_i is given by the equation $AA^T * u_i = σ_i^2 * u_i$. This equation is derived from the properties of SVD, and it says that the left singular vectors u_i are eigenvectors of the matrix AA^T, and the corresponding eigenvalues are the squares of the singular values σ_i.
    
    If you divide both sides of the equation $AA^T * u_i = σ_i^2 * u_i$ by σ_i (assuming σ_i ≠ 0), you'd get $AA^T * u_i / σ_i = σ_i * u_i$, not A * v_i / σ_i. The term on the left is a scalar times a left singular vector, and the term on the right is a left singular vector scaled by a singular value. There's no direct relationship with the right singular vectors v_i in this equation.
    
    So, to summarize: while AA^T * u_i = σ_i^2 * u_i and A * v_i = σ_i * u_i are both true relationships in the context of SVD, dividing these equations through by σ_i doesn't give you an equation relating u_i and v_i in the way that you suggested.
    
- does A^T * u = v?
    
    In the context of SVD, the relationship between A, U, and V is typically expressed as follows:
    
    A * v_i = σ_i * u_i
    
    A^T * u_i = σ_i * v_i

- A matrix takes basis vector x,y in space A and transforms them into vector u, v in space B, where u and v are the columns of the matrix. is this true?
    
    Yes, that's an accurate description of how a matrix represents a linear transformation. Here's a little more detail:
    
    A matrix represents a linear transformation from one vector space to another. If you have a matrix A and vectors x and y in the domain space, the transformed vectors u and v in the target space are given by the matrix-vector multiplications u = Ax and v = Ay.
    
    The columns of the matrix A are particularly important. If x and y are basis vectors of the domain space (for example, the standard basis vectors in 2D space), then the columns of A are the images of these basis vectors under the transformation. That is, the first column of A is the image of the first basis vector, and the second column of A is the image of the second basis vector. This is because when you multiply A by a basis vector, you're effectively taking a linear combination of the columns of A, and a basis vector selects out a single column.
    
    So, in the special case where x and y are basis vectors, it's true to say that the matrix A "transforms the basis vectors x and y in space A into the vectors u and v in space B, where u and v are the columns of the matrix A". However, remember that this interpretation depends on the choice of basis vectors x and y. For different vectors x and y, the transformed vectors u and v would not in general be the columns of A.
    
- Given a Jacobian matrix with cols [du/dx, dv/dx] and [du/dy, dv/dy], what are the basis vectors and spaces for this case?
    
    The Jacobian matrix you mentioned, with columns [du/dx, dv/dx] and [du/dy, dv/dy], represents a linear transformation that maps from the domain space (x, y) to the target space (u, v).
    
    The Jacobian matrix represents how small changes in x and y (the basis vectors of the domain space) affect u and v (in the target space). Specifically, the entry du/dx tells you how much u changes for a small change in x, holding y constant, and similarly for the other entries of the Jacobian matrix.
    
    The columns of the Jacobian matrix are not the basis vectors of the target space (u, v); rather, they represent the rates of change of the functions u(x, y) and v(x, y) with respect to the variables x and y. But they do tell you how the basis vectors of the domain space (x, y) get mapped to the target space (u, v) under the transformation defined by the Jacobian.

The matrix J maps x onto u based on its derivative. In this case, the derivative of 2x is 2.

Now, what if u was a function, say x^2? How can the values of the matrix be variables and still make sense in the geometric interpretation?

J = [du/dx] = [2x]

- if matrices map from linear systems to linear systems, and (x,y) is linear but u is a nonlinear function, how can the Jacobian map to u?
    
    Good question. Let's clarify something important here. Matrices represent linear transformations, and the concept of linearity refers to two properties: additivity (or superposition) and homogeneity (or scaling). A transformation (or function) is linear if it preserves these two properties.
    
    When we say that a function like u = f(x, y) = x^2 is nonlinear, we're referring to the fact that the function doesn't preserve these properties. For example, f(x + y) is not equal to f(x) + f(y) for this function.
    
    However, when we compute the Jacobian of a function like f(x, y) = x^2, what we're actually doing is approximating the function by a linear function near each point (x, y). That is, we're finding the best linear approximation to the function at each point. This is a process called linearization, and it's central to much of calculus.
    
    The resulting Jacobian matrix then represents a linear transformation that approximates the original nonlinear function near a specific point. This transformation maps small changes in the input variables (x, y) to corresponding changes in the output variable u.
    
    So, while the function u = f(x, y) = x^2 is nonlinear, the Jacobian provides a linear approximation of this function at each point. That's how we can use matrices (which represent linear transformations) to study nonlinear functions.
    
- So is the range of this jacboain still have u as a basis? Then u is a basis vector. But u is also a nonlinear function x^2
    
    In the context of Jacobian matrices, the term "basis" refers to a basis of the domain or the codomain of the function being studied. In this case, we are considering a function u = f(x) = x^2.
    
    The function's domain is a subset of the real numbers (which we can visualize as a line), and its codomain is also a subset of the real numbers (another line). A basis for the domain or the codomain, in this case, would simply be the number 1 (a single nonzero number forms a basis for the line).
    
    We should be careful not to confuse the function u(x) = x^2 itself with the "u" in a basis. When we refer to a "basis," we're talking about a set of vectors that span a vector space. The "u" in a basis for the codomain of the function f(x) = x^2 is not the same as the function u(x) = x^2. Instead, it's just a label for an axis (like "x" or "y" in 2D space).
    
    When we compute the Jacobian of the function f(x) = x^2, the result is the derivative 2x, which is a function that gives the best linear approximation to f(x) = x^2 at each point x. It doesn't make sense to think of this derivative as a "basis" because it's not a set of vectors -- it's a function.
    
    The Jacobian, or derivative in this case, provides a way to approximate the function near each point, but it doesn't change the basis of the domain or codomain. Those are still just the real numbers, with basis {1}.
    
    I hope this helps clarify the concept. The language of linear algebra (bases, vector spaces, linear transformations) can be a bit abstract, but the key point is that a Jacobian matrix provides a way to approximate a nonlinear function by a linear one, which allows us to use the tools of linear algebra to study the function.
    

SOLN: It’s NOT mapped to u. chatGPT is wrong. It’s mapped to dx. And dx is a linear function

This is because in a matrix, the first basis is mapped to the first col of A. The first col is dx

- Is dx a linear function? Is it a vector?
    
    The notation "dx" is often used in calculus and it can represent different concepts based on the context, which sometimes can be confusing.
    
    1. Differential: In the context of differential calculus, "dx" can represent a small change or increment in the variable x. For example, in the derivative df/dx, "dx" refers to a small change in x.
    2. Differential operator: "dx" can also be viewed as a differential operator, which when applied to a function gives its derivative.
    3. In the context of integrals, "dx" represents an infinitesimally small width of a rectangle under the curve of a function in a Riemann sum.
    
    "dx" is not a function nor a vector in the traditional sense, but rather it's part of the notation used in calculus to represent the concepts mentioned above.
    
    However, in the context of differential geometry and in certain areas of theoretical physics, differentials like "dx" can be considered as differential 1-forms, which can be thought of as a kind of "vector" in an abstract space, but this is a more advanced topic that goes beyond standard calculus.
    
- Does the Jacobian J=2 given function u =2x map onto the differential 1-form?
    
    In the context of differential geometry, differential 1-forms can be thought of as linear functions that act on vectors. They're a bit different from traditional functions in calculus, as they live in the dual space (space of all linear functionals) to the tangent space at a point on a manifold.
    
    Let's get back to your question: given a function u = 2x, its Jacobian (derivative in this case) is indeed J = 2.
    
    In the language of differential 1-forms, the differential of the function u = 2x is du = 2 dx. The "2 dx" here is a differential 1-form. The number "2" is the coefficient of the differential 1-form, and "dx" is the basis of the space of differential 1-forms.
    
    When you integrate a differential 1-form over a path (or, more generally, when you integrate a differential k-form over a k-dimensional surface), you're adding up the values of the 1-form at each point along the path (or surface). This corresponds to the fundamental theorem of calculus when k = 1.
    
    So, yes, in a certain sense, the Jacobian (derivative) of the function maps onto a differential 1-form, but it's important to keep in mind that these are different mathematical objects that live in different spaces: the function and its derivative are real-valued functions (they map from the real numbers to the real numbers), whereas a differential 1-form is an object in the dual space to the tangent space of a manifold.
    
- are differential forms vectors?
    
    Differential forms are not vectors in the traditional sense. While both vectors and differential forms are mathematical objects used in differential geometry, they have different properties and interpretations.
    
    Vectors, also known as tangent vectors, are geometric objects that represent directions and magnitudes in a vector space. They can be represented by arrays of numbers or arrows in Euclidean space. Vectors can be added, multiplied by scalars, and undergo various operations like dot product and cross product.
    
    On the other hand, differential forms are geometric objects that describe quantities related to orientation, area, volume, and flow. They are closely tied to the concept of differential geometry and calculus. Differential forms can be thought of as objects that assign an antisymmetric array of numbers (or functions) to each point in a manifold. The numbers represent the coefficients of the form, and their antisymmetry captures the notion of orientation.
    
    Differential forms can be multiplied by scalars and undergo operations like wedge product and exterior derivative, which allow for the calculation of integration, differentiation, and other geometric operations.
    
    While vectors and differential forms have different algebraic structures and interpretations, there is a close relationship between them. In fact, given a smooth manifold, the space of differential 1-forms at a point is the dual space of the tangent space at that point. This duality allows for a correspondence between vectors and 1-forms through operations such as the interior product.
    
    In summary, vectors and differential forms are distinct mathematical objects used in differential geometry, but they are related through duality and play complementary roles in describing geometric properties of manifolds.
    
- What is the vector [df1/x, df2/dx, ... dfn/dx]?
    
    The vector you provided, [df₁/dx, df₂/dx, ..., dfₙ/dx], represents the partial derivatives of a function f with respect to the variable x. Each component of the vector corresponds to the partial derivative of f with respect to the respective coordinate variable.
    
    If you have a function f(x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ) defined on an n-dimensional space, the partial derivative df/dx can be calculated by taking the derivative of f with respect to x while keeping all other variables constant. This operation is denoted as ∂f/∂x or df/dx.
    
    The vector [df₁/dx, df₂/dx, ..., dfₙ/dx] captures the rates at which the function f changes along each coordinate direction. It provides information about the sensitivity of the function with respect to changes in the variable x.
    
    It's worth noting that this vector representation assumes that the function f is differentiable and that the partial derivatives exist for each component.
    
- Is there a name or variable for this vector?
    
    Yes, the vector [df₁/dx, df₂/dx, ..., dfₙ/dx] can be referred to as the gradient of the function f with respect to the variable x. It is commonly denoted as ∇f or grad(f).
    
    The gradient is a fundamental concept in vector calculus and differential geometry. It represents the vector field that points in the direction of the steepest ascent of the function f at each point in its domain. The magnitude of the gradient vector corresponds to the rate of change or the slope of the function in that direction.
    
    The gradient vector has applications in various fields, including optimization, physics, computer science, and engineering. It provides valuable information about the behavior of functions and is often used to solve problems related to finding extrema, optimizing functions, and solving differential equations.
    
- Is the gradient a differential form?
    
    The gradient is not a differential form in the strict sense. Differential forms are mathematical objects that assign antisymmetric arrays of numbers or functions to each point in a manifold. They capture information about orientation, area, volume, and flow.
    
    On the other hand, the gradient is a vector field, which is a collection of vectors defined at each point in a space. In the context of vector calculus, the gradient represents the vector field associated with the partial derivatives of a scalar function. It points in the direction of the steepest ascent of the function and has both magnitude and direction.
    
    While the gradient is not a differential form itself, there is a connection between them. In differential geometry, the exterior derivative of a 0-form (a function) gives rise to a 1-form (a differential form). The gradient of a scalar function can be seen as a 1-form in this context. It is the 1-form that, when contracted with a tangent vector (vector field), gives the directional derivative of the function along that vector.
    
    So, while the gradient is not a differential form in its own right, it has a relationship to differential forms through the concept of exterior derivatives and the duality between vectors and 1-forms.
    
- Is the gradient a vector?
    
    Yes, the gradient is a vector. In the context of vector calculus, the gradient is a vector field that represents the vector pointing in the direction of the steepest ascent of a scalar function at each point in space.
    
    For a scalar function f(x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ), the gradient is denoted as ∇f or grad(f). It is defined as a vector with components given by the partial derivatives of the function with respect to each coordinate variable:
    
    ∇f = (df/dx₁, df/dx₂, ..., df/dxₙ).
    
    The gradient vector has both magnitude and direction. Its magnitude represents the rate of change or the slope of the function in the direction of steepest ascent, and its direction points in that direction. The gradient provides information about how the function varies as you move through the space.
    
    The gradient is an important concept in calculus, optimization, and physics. It is commonly used to find extrema of functions, solve optimization problems, calculate directional derivatives, and solve differential equations.
    
- How can the gradient be both a vector and a vector field?
    
    I apologize for any confusion caused by my previous response. To clarify, the gradient is a vector field, not a single vector.
    
    A vector field is a collection of vectors defined at each point in a space. In the case of the gradient, it is a vector field that associates a vector with each point in the domain of a scalar function. Each vector in the gradient field points in the direction of the steepest ascent of the function at the corresponding point.
    
    So, while the gradient is not a single vector, it is a vector field that assigns a vector to each point in space. Each vector in the field represents the direction and magnitude of the steepest ascent of the function at that point.
    
    In summary, the gradient is a vector field consisting of vectors that represent the direction of the steepest ascent of a scalar function at each point in space.

The gradient AT A POINT P is a tangent vector. 

- Is the gradient at a point a tangent vector, but the gradient of a function (whose domain are points) a vector field?
    
    Yes, that is correct. The gradient at a point is a tangent vector, while the gradient of a function is a vector field.
    
    At a specific point in the domain of a scalar function, the gradient represents a tangent vector. It is a vector that is tangent to the level set of the function at that point, pointing in the direction of steepest ascent of the function at that location. The magnitude of the gradient vector corresponds to the rate of change or the slope of the function in that direction.
    
    On the other hand, the gradient of a function is a vector field. It is a collection of tangent vectors assigned to each point in the domain of the function. The gradient vector field maps each point to its corresponding tangent vector, providing a continuous distribution of vectors throughout the domain. This vector field captures the directions and magnitudes of the steepest ascent of the function at each point.
    
    So, to summarize, the gradient at a point is a tangent vector representing the direction of steepest ascent at that specific location, while the gradient of a function is a vector field that assigns a tangent vector to each point in the domain of the function.
    

- So are the basis vectors of the jacobian at a point the tangent vectors at that point, given gradients for each function?
    
    No, the basis vectors of the Jacobian matrix at a point are not the same as the tangent vectors at that point given gradients for each function.
    
    Let's clarify the concepts:
    
    1. Tangent vectors: Tangent vectors represent directions in the tangent space at a specific point on a manifold. They describe local directions and changes at that point. Tangent vectors are often used in differential geometry to study the geometry of manifolds.
    2. Gradients: Gradients, as we discussed earlier, are vectors that represent the direction of steepest ascent of a scalar function at a specific point. They provide information about the rate of change of the function in different directions.
    3. Jacobian matrix: The Jacobian matrix is a matrix that represents the partial derivatives of a vector-valued function with respect to its independent variables. It is used to linearize and study the local behavior of a vector-valued function around a point.
    
    Now, to address your question: The basis vectors of the Jacobian matrix at a point are not the same as the tangent vectors at that point given gradients for each function. The Jacobian matrix provides information about the linear approximation of a vector-valued function near a point, while tangent vectors describe the local directions and changes at a point.
    
    The tangent vectors at a point are typically obtained from a tangent basis of the manifold, such as a coordinate basis or an orthonormal basis derived from a metric structure. These tangent vectors are not directly related to the gradients of the individual functions involved in the Jacobian matrix.
    
    In summary, the basis vectors of the Jacobian matrix represent the partial derivatives of a vector-valued function, while the tangent vectors represent directions and changes at a specific point on a manifold. They are distinct concepts with different interpretations and uses in differential geometry and calculus.
    
- So are the basis vectors from the domain are mapped by the Jacobian to the tangent vectors at that point, given gradients for each function?
    
    Yes, that is correct. The basis vectors from the domain, when mapped by the Jacobian matrix, can provide a set of tangent vectors at a specific point.
    
    When you have a vector-valued function defined on a manifold, the Jacobian matrix represents the linear transformation between the tangent spaces of the domain and the target space. The columns of the Jacobian matrix correspond to the partial derivatives of the components of the vector-valued function with respect to the coordinates of the domain.
    
    If you consider a point in the domain of the vector-valued function, the basis vectors of the domain, when multiplied by the Jacobian matrix, yield the tangent vectors at that point in the target space. These tangent vectors represent the directions and rates of change of the function at that specific point.
    
    In other words, the columns of the Jacobian matrix can be viewed as the tangent vectors in the target space associated with the basis vectors of the domain. The Jacobian matrix provides a way to map the tangent vectors from the domain to the tangent vectors in the target space at a given point.
    
    So, to summarize, the Jacobian matrix allows you to relate the basis vectors of the domain to the tangent vectors at a specific point by providing a linear transformation between the tangent spaces.
    
- When we say "basis vectors at that domain", are we treating the point as the origin of the domain?
    
    No, when we refer to the "basis vectors at that domain," we are not treating the point as the origin of the domain. The basis vectors of the domain are independent vectors that span the tangent space at a given point on the manifold.
    
    In the context of a differentiable manifold, the tangent space at a point represents all possible tangent vectors that can be attached to that point. The tangent space is a vector space, and it has a basis consisting of independent tangent vectors.
    
    The basis vectors at a point in the domain do not assume that the point is the origin of the domain. Rather, they provide a set of linearly independent directions that span the tangent space at that point. These basis vectors can be chosen to be any independent set of tangent vectors, such as a coordinate basis or a basis derived from a metric structure.
    
    The choice of basis vectors may depend on the specific application or coordinate system used, but it is important to note that the basis vectors do not assume the point to be the origin of the domain. They simply provide a local set of directions that span the tangent space at that point.
    

basis vectors from the domain are mapped by the Jacobian to the tangent vectors at that point

Jacobian with 1 column is m x 1. Point is 1x1 (each col of input is an observation, so 1 obs is 1 col). Thus, output is mx1, which is an m-dim vector.

- Why is a jacobian used to define a linear map bewten two tangent spaces at two points in separates spaces?
    
    The Jacobian matrix is used to define a linear map between two tangent spaces at two points in separate spaces because it provides a way to approximate the local behavior of a smooth map near a given point.
    
    Consider two manifolds, each with their own tangent spaces, and a smooth map that connects points on these manifolds. When you have a map between these manifolds, the Jacobian matrix represents the linearization of that map at a particular point.
    
    The Jacobian matrix captures the derivatives of the components of the map with respect to the coordinates of the domain. By evaluating the Jacobian matrix at a specific point, you obtain a linear map between the tangent spaces of the two manifolds at that point.
    
    This linear map serves as an approximation of the map's behavior near the point of evaluation. It provides a linear relationship between the tangent vectors at the two points, allowing you to study how vectors in the tangent space at one point relate to vectors in the tangent space at another point.
    
    By considering the Jacobian matrix, you can analyze properties such as local linearity, differentiability, and how the map distorts or preserves lengths and angles locally. It provides a tool to understand the relationship between tangent spaces at different points on separate manifolds.
    
    In summary, the Jacobian matrix is used to define a linear map between tangent spaces at two points in separate spaces to approximate the local behavior of a smooth map and study the relationship between tangent vectors at different points.
    

- Let f be a map between spaces X and H, each with multiple dims. So we have f(x) = h. This means we have dh/dx. This is one function. But a Jacobian’s cols each represent a function. Would the Jacobian be one col? Or would it be multiple cols because each dim of h is considered a separate function?
    
    In the scenario you described, where you have a map f from a space X to a space H, with f(x) = h, the Jacobian matrix will typically have multiple columns. Each column of the Jacobian matrix represents the partial derivatives of the components of the map with respect to the coordinates of the domain.
    
    Let's break it down:
    
    - X: The space X represents the domain of the map f. It can have multiple dimensions, denoted as x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ.
    - H: The space H represents the target space of the map f. It can also have multiple dimensions, denoted as h₁, h₂, ..., hₘ.
    - f(x) = h: This equation represents the map f that takes a point x in the domain and maps it to a point h in the target space.
    
    Now, the Jacobian matrix represents the linearization of the map f at a particular point in the domain. Since both the domain X and the target space H can have multiple dimensions, the Jacobian matrix will have multiple columns, with each column corresponding to the partial derivatives of the components of h with respect to the components of x.
    
    For example, if X is an n-dimensional space and H is an m-dimensional space, the Jacobian matrix will have m columns, and each column will represent the partial derivatives of the components of h with respect to each component of x. Therefore, the Jacobian matrix will have dimensions m × n.
    
    To summarize, in the scenario you described, the Jacobian matrix will typically have multiple columns, representing the partial derivatives of the components of the target space H with respect to the components of the domain X.
    

So the Jacobian sends points from x into points in h. However, the basis used for h are the tangent vectors in the tangent space. This is the case for EVERY Jacobian matrix; it was never using the basis vector of (x,y) in the first place, but (dx, dy) !

- Are tangent vectors the basis vectors in a tangent space?
    
    Yes, in a tangent space, the tangent vectors form a basis for that space.
    
    In the context of differential geometry, a tangent space is associated with each point on a manifold. The tangent space at a point represents all possible tangent vectors that can be attached to that point. Tangent vectors in the tangent space describe local directions and changes at that point.
    
    A basis for the tangent space is a set of tangent vectors that are linearly independent and span the entire tangent space. This means that any tangent vector in the tangent space can be expressed as a linear combination of the basis vectors.
    
    The tangent vectors in the basis provide a framework for describing directions and changes in the local neighborhood of a point on the manifold. They play a crucial role in understanding the geometry and differential calculus on the manifold.
    
    So, in summary, tangent vectors form the basis for the tangent space at each point on a manifold. They provide a set of linearly independent directions that span the tangent space and enable the study of local behavior and calculus on the manifold.
    

Now, the Jacobian goes from basis vector in T_x(I), a tangent space, to another tangent space. Each basis in T_h is $dh_1 = [dh_1 / dx_1, dh_1 / dx_2, …]$. These are the rows.

HOWEVER, each basis vector from T_x is sent, instead, to the cols $[dh_1 / dx_1, dh_2 / dx_1 …]$. This new vector in T_h represents the measurement of dx for each dh. It is the projection of dx onto each dh_i (or the other way around?)

Thus, we know what basis elements the Jacobian acts on and sends to: from one tangent space to another. This means the functions are not basis vectors at these spaces; the tangent vectors at a point of the function are.

Next, what’s the singular vectors of this Jacobian? These vectors are in tangent space, and are rotated onto another tangent space. Remember, vectors are not fixed to a point, but can be moved around. They are characterized by direction and length. This means a tangent space (set of vectors) at one place is equivalent to a tangent space at another; it is NOT fixed onto the manifold, but external to it.

- is this true?
    
    Yes, you are correct. Tangent spaces are not fixed onto the manifold but are external to it. Tangent spaces exist independently of the manifold and can be defined at each point on the manifold.
    
    Tangent spaces are vector spaces that capture the local properties of the manifold at a specific point. They consist of tangent vectors that represent directions and changes at that point. Tangent vectors are characterized by their direction and length but are not tied to a particular point on the manifold.
    
    Importantly, tangent spaces are defined consistently across the manifold. The tangent space at one point is equivalent to the tangent space at another point. This equivalence arises from the fact that tangent spaces are constructed based on the local behavior of the manifold, and their definitions are independent of any specific point.
    
    Tangent spaces provide a way to study the geometry and differential calculus on the manifold. By considering tangent vectors and tangent spaces, we can understand the local directions, rates of change, and other geometric properties of the manifold at each point.
    
    In summary, tangent spaces are external to the manifold, and their definitions are consistent across the manifold. They capture local properties and consist of tangent vectors that describe directions and changes. Tangent spaces play a crucial role in understanding the geometry and differential calculus on the manifold.

This useful video still doesn’t explain Jacobian mapping from tangent space to tangent space based on matrix interpretation. Nor do a lot of books. In fact, on the web, this is stated somewhere, but it is not easily found nor intuitively, visually shown. It’s just implied and known.

So stating that we are using dx as basis vectors of tangent space, and using jacobian to send them to $\nabla_x h$ (a vector in $T_h$ ) is novel bc of how directly, explicitly stated, to-the-point it is, instead of being inferred and implied after studying the subject.

Now, the singular vectors of the Jacobian transform T_x into T_h. We transform T_x by a rotation, scaling, then rotation again.

Jv = USV^Tv = US, because V^T v = identity

Are the right singular vectors from the domain vector space, and the left singular vectors in the target vector space?

Don’t interpret it this way.

V would place basis onto right singular vector. But V^-1 = V^T places right singular onto basis. The original basis are not named here.

So we go from original basis, and always end up at left singular vectors.

Ax = lamb*x

Jv = sigma*u

In the case of Jv, it is not doing anything to v. Rather, it is stretching u. This is because V^T v “negates” v by just focusing on the basis vectors. It stretches the basis, then rotates. That’s it. 

However, Jp, for any vector p, projects x onto V, the right singular vectors. it  interprets p in terms of the right singular vectors- for instance, if the mat was Jacobian and right singular were vectors (not necc tangents) such as “nap”, it interprets p in those terms. It stretches it by “nap”, then rotates by u. This requires v, b/c we are not scaling the original basis (in j, it’s d/dx), but scaling the right singular vectors. 

In the case of the Jacobian, the original basis vectors are the tangent vectors d/dx, etc! 

- The right singular vectors are the eigenvectors of A^T A. For Jacobian, it’s $J^T J$. What’s the interpretation of this matrix product in terms of derivatives and forms?
    
    The matrix product A^T A, where A is the Jacobian matrix, has a specific interpretation in terms of derivatives and forms. Let's explore it further.
    
    The Jacobian matrix J represents the derivative of a vector-valued function. Suppose you have a function F: ℝ^n → ℝ^m, and you evaluate the Jacobian matrix J at a specific point x₀ in the domain of F. Then J is an m×n matrix, where each entry represents the partial derivative of the corresponding component of F with respect to the variables in the domain.
    
    Now, let's consider the matrix product J^T J. Here, J^T denotes the transpose of the Jacobian matrix. The resulting matrix J^T J is an n×n matrix.
    
    The interpretation of J^T J in terms of derivatives and forms relates to the concept of the Hessian matrix, which is a generalization of the second derivative of a scalar-valued function to multivariable functions.
    
    For a scalar-valued function f: ℝ^n → ℝ, the Hessian matrix is given by the matrix of second partial derivatives of f. If we denote the Hessian matrix as H, then the elements of H are defined as:
    
    H(i, j) = ∂²f/∂xᵢ∂xⱼ
    
    Now, suppose we have a vector-valued function F: ℝ^n → ℝ^m. The matrix product J^T J has a similar interpretation as the Hessian matrix but for vector-valued functions.
    
    The (i, j)-th element of J^T J represents the dot product of the column vectors in the Jacobian matrix associated with the i-th and j-th variables. In other words, it captures the interaction between the partial derivatives of the vector components of F with respect to the i-th and j-th variables.
    
    Therefore, the matrix product J^T J can be seen as a generalization of the Hessian matrix to vector-valued functions. It encodes information about the interactions and dependencies between the partial derivatives of the vector components with respect to different variables, providing insights into the curvature and geometry of the function in the domain.
    

- is the hessian matrix the product of jacobian with its transpose?
    
    No, the Hessian matrix is not the product of the Jacobian matrix with its transpose. The Hessian matrix is a square matrix of second partial derivatives of a scalar-valued function, while the Jacobian matrix is a matrix of partial derivatives of a vector-valued function.
    
    The Hessian matrix H of a scalar-valued function f: ℝ^n → ℝ is defined as an n×n matrix with elements:
    
    H(i, j) = ∂²f/∂xᵢ∂xⱼ
    
    Each element of the Hessian matrix represents the second partial derivative of the function f with respect to the variables xᵢ and xⱼ.
    
    On the other hand, the Jacobian matrix J is used for vector-valued functions. If you have a vector-valued function F: ℝ^n → ℝ^m, the Jacobian matrix J is an m×n matrix whose elements are the partial derivatives of the components of F with respect to the variables in the domain.
    
    The product of the Jacobian matrix J with its transpose J^T gives an m×m matrix, which is not equivalent to the Hessian matrix. The product J^T J is often used in optimization and regression problems to compute the normal equations or as a measure of curvature, but it is not the same as the Hessian matrix.
    

- Calculate product J^T J
    
    
- what is the product of two derivatives? can you multiply dh/dx * dh/dx?
    
    Apologies for the confusion. The product of two derivatives, such as dh/dx * dh/dx, is known as the second derivative or the derivative of the derivative.
    
    If you have a function h(x) and you take the derivative of h(x) with respect to x, denoted as dh/dx, you obtain the first derivative. Taking the derivative again yields the second derivative, which can be denoted as d²h/dx² or (dh/dx)².
    
    However, it is important to note that the expression (dh/dx)² does not represent the multiplication of two separate derivatives dh/dx * dh/dx. Instead, it represents the square of the first derivative, which is the second derivative.
    
    In summary, the product of two derivatives, such as dh/dx * dh/dx, is commonly understood as the square of the first derivative, which is the second derivative of the function h(x).
    

Therapist says: J^T J, unfortunately, has no clear interpretation (write its elements out) “that I know of, though perhaps someone else does”.

- What is dh/dx * dh/dx + dh/dy * dh/dx called? What is it similar to?
    
    The expression dh/dx * dh/dx + dh/dy * dh/dx is called the mixed second partial derivative of the function h(x, y) with respect to x.
    
    It is similar to the concept of the Hessian matrix, which represents the matrix of second partial derivatives of a function. The Hessian matrix is often denoted as H and has elements H(i, j) = ∂²h/∂xᵢ∂xⱼ.
    
    In the given expression, the terms dh/dx * dh/dx and dh/dy * dh/dx correspond to the second partial derivatives of h(x, y) with respect to x. More specifically:
    
    - dh/dx * dh/dx represents (∂h/∂x)², which is the second partial derivative of h with respect to x.
    - dh/dy * dh/dx represents (∂h/∂y)(∂h/∂x), which is the mixed partial derivative of h with respect to x and y.
    
    Therefore, the expression dh/dx * dh/dx + dh/dy * dh/dx is a combination of the second partial derivative of h with respect to x and the mixed partial derivative of h with respect to x and y. It captures the interaction and dependence of the function h(x, y) on both x and y, providing information about the curvature and variations of the function with respect to these variables.

J^T J is square, but not easily interpretable. To know what right singular are, we must know what J^T J is because right singular are its eigenvectors.

Our aim is to find u such that:

![Untitled](SVD%20b6e01b133b7d495b81236acafc3cea9b/Untitled%206.png)

1. Get v from A^T A
2. Now rearrange. Then we just need to find a way to calculate U. We SEPARATELY calculate u using the eigenvectors of A A^T

Imagine A has dims nap and red. Then A^T A has first elem nap*nap + nap*nose. nap*nose is a projection? No. Think of it in terms of units.

nap/nose * nap/nose = nap^2 / nose^2 . This is saying how many times squared nap goes into squared nose. It projects nose^2 onto nap^2. This not interpretable, esp when added with other things.

So for now we should end trying to “interpret” eigenvectors of A^T A in terms of the basis vectors of A (eg if they represented nap), and thus right singular vectors. Instead, just treat them on a surface level and say why we use them, and how to derive them.

nap / ear —> dh_1 / dx_1

Thus showing each unit vector is a derivative.

- What is dx? A vector?
    
    In the context of calculus, "dx" typically represents an infinitesimal change or differential of the variable x. It is not a vector in this context.
    
    "dx" is often used as part of an integral to indicate the variable of integration or as part of a derivative to represent the variable with respect to which differentiation is being performed. It is commonly treated as an infinitesimally small quantity.
    
    In some advanced mathematical contexts, such as differential forms in differential geometry, "dx" can be interpreted as a 1-form, which is a mathematical object that assigns a value to each tangent vector at a point. In this context, "dx" represents a covector or a dual vector.
    
    However, in basic calculus and most common applications, "dx" is not treated as a vector. It is used primarily to indicate the variable with respect to which integration or differentiation is performed and to help construct integrals or derivatives.
    
- Is dx a tangent vector?
    
    In the context of calculus, "dx" by itself is not considered a tangent vector. Instead, it is commonly used to represent an infinitesimal change or differential of the variable x.
    
    In differential geometry, tangent vectors are associated with points on a manifold and represent directions and changes at those points. They are vectors that belong to the tangent space at a specific point.
    
    While "dx" is not inherently a tangent vector, it can be used to define tangent vectors in certain contexts. For example, if you have a parametric curve in a manifold defined by functions x(t) and y(t), the tangent vector at a point can be expressed as a linear combination of the derivatives dx/dt and dy/dt.
    
    So, while "dx" alone is not typically considered a tangent vector, it can be used alongside other differentials or derivatives to construct tangent vectors in specific situations.

- what notation is used to represent tangent vectors as basis in a tangent space?
    
    In differential geometry, the notation commonly used to represent tangent vectors as a basis in a tangent space depends on the context and the choice of coordinate systems or indices.
    
    Here are a few commonly used notations:
    
    1. Coordinate Basis: In a coordinate basis, the tangent vectors are typically denoted as partial derivatives with respect to the coordinate variables. For example, in a two-dimensional space, the tangent vectors can be written as (dx/dx₁, dx/dx₂) or (∂/∂x₁, ∂/∂x₂), where x₁ and x₂ are the coordinate variables.
    2. Index Notation: In index notation, tangent vectors can be represented using indices. For example, in a three-dimensional space, a tangent vector can be denoted as Vᵢ, where i takes values from 1 to 3. The index notation allows for concise representation of tangent vectors and simplifies operations such as contraction and raising/lowering indices using the metric tensor.
    3. Abstract Index Notation: In abstract index notation, tangent vectors are represented using abstract indices, such as Vₐ, Vₘ, etc. The abstract index notation is a more formal representation that abstracts away the specific coordinate systems and emphasizes the geometric and algebraic properties of tangent vectors.
    
    It's important to note that these notations are just conventions, and different sources or authors may use slightly different notations based on their preference or the specific context of the discussion. The choice of notation may also depend on the level of formality and mathematical rigor being employed.
    
    In any case, the notation used should be clear and consistent within the given context to properly represent the tangent vectors as a basis in a tangent space.

algebraically solve A and A^T A, and also visually plot them. Is there a pattern for all A?

also do this for singular vectors and eigenvectors. pattern?

finally, plug in values for basis dims (eg. nap) and see how they cause diff “change in units” algebraically and geometrically. interpret the resulting units

eigenvector: just stretched

singular: stretched then rotated

Av = sigma * u

A^T A v = A^T sigma * u 

A^T A v = lambda * v ?= v

- Does A^A A = identity?
    
    No, in general, the product of a matrix A with its transpose A^T (or A^A) does not result in the identity matrix, unless A is an orthogonal matrix.
    
    If A is an orthogonal matrix, then A^T = A^(-1), where A^(-1) is the inverse of A. In this case, we have:
    
    A^T * A = A^(-1) * A = I,
    
    where I represents the identity matrix.
    
    However, for a general matrix A, the product A^T * A does not necessarily equal the identity matrix. The resulting matrix will depend on the specific properties and structure of matrix A.
    

A^T sigma * u = lambda * v = sigma * sigma * v

A^T u = sigma v

A A^ T u ******************************=****************************** lambda * u = A sigma v

A v = sigma u (back to where we started)

A^T is not always a rotation b/c A is not always orthogonal

So what does A^T do to sigma * u? It causes it to equal lambda * v

sigma * u: stretch u

lambda * v: stretch v MORE (2x amount of sigma)

A^T A v = A^T sigma * u = lambda * v

A A^ T u ******************************=****************************** A sigma v = lambda * u

Multiplying by A^T or A causes eigenvector to rotate and scale into singular vctor

Why does every square mat have (real or complex) eigenvector? Proof

- prove every square symmetric has real eigenvector
    
    To prove that every square symmetric matrix has real eigenvectors, we can use the Spectral Theorem, which states that every symmetric matrix is orthogonally diagonalizable.
    
    Let A be a square symmetric matrix. By the Spectral Theorem, there exists an orthogonal matrix P such that P^T * A * P = D, where D is a diagonal matrix with the eigenvalues of A on its diagonal.
    
    Let's consider an eigenvector x of A with eigenvalue λ. This means that Ax = λx. We can express x in terms of the columns of P as x = P * y, where y is a vector.
    
    Substituting this expression into the eigenvector equation, we have:
    
    A(P * y) = λ(P * y).
    
    Multiplying both sides by P^T from the left, we get:
    
    P^T * A * (P * y) = λ(P^T * P * y).
    
    Since P is an orthogonal matrix, P^T * P = I (the identity matrix). Therefore, the equation becomes:
    
    P^T * A * P * y = λI * y,
    
    which simplifies to:
    
    D * y = λy.
    
    Here, D is a diagonal matrix with the eigenvalues of A on its diagonal. We can see that multiplying y by D simply scales the vector y by the eigenvalues. Since D is a diagonal matrix, the scaling factor λ applies independently to each component of y.
    
    Therefore, we have shown that the eigenvector y (and hence x = P * y) is a real vector, as it is not affected by any complex scaling factors. Since x is expressed in terms of the columns of the orthogonal matrix P, which are real vectors, x itself must be a real vector.
    
    Hence, every square symmetric matrix has real eigenvectors.

the eigenvectors are linear combos of basis, which have interpretation. so the ratio of the basis features describe what eigenvectors represent.

Eg) if eigenvector is 0.8 body and 0.3 face, that’s “more cat like”.

Thus, this is a new feature that doesn’t rely on body and face, but more on the ratio, to describe the matrix. Just keeping this ratio while discarding all other considerations (other combinations of basis features) is enough.

Now, this is intuitive when A’s basis are “interpretable”. But A^T * A elements are a combination of these units, so may not be. We can try to input them into chatgpt to see if it finds ones that fit.

- Let A = [a b, c d]. What are the values of A^T * A? express in latex
    
    $A^T * A = \begin{bmatrix}
    a & c \\
    b & d \\
    \end{bmatrix} * \begin{bmatrix}
    a & b \\
    c & d \\
    \end{bmatrix}  = \begin{bmatrix}
    a^2 + c^2 & ab + cd \\
    ab + cd & b^2 + d^2 \\
    \end{bmatrix}$
    
- Let a = nap/nose, b = nap/ear ; c = luck/nose, d = luck/ear. Substitute these values into the following:
    
    Substituting the given values into the expression:
    
    $A^T * A = \begin{bmatrix}
    \frac{nap}{nose} & \frac{luck}{nose} \\
    \frac{nap}{ear} & \frac{luck}{ear} \\
    \end{bmatrix} * \begin{bmatrix}
    \frac{nap}{nose} & \frac{nap}{ear} \\
    \frac{luck}{nose} & \frac{luck}{ear} \\
    \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
    \left(\frac{nap}{nose}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{luck}{nose}\right)^2 & \left(\frac{nap}{nose}\right)\left(\frac{nap}{ear}\right) + \left(\frac{luck}{nose}\right)\left(\frac{luck}{ear}\right) \\
    \left(\frac{nap}{nose}\right)\left(\frac{nap}{ear}\right) + \left(\frac{luck}{nose}\right)\left(\frac{luck}{ear}\right) & \left(\frac{nap}{ear}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{luck}{ear}\right)^2 \\
    \end{bmatrix}$
    
    Simplifying the expression further, we have:
    
    $A^T * A = \begin{bmatrix}
    \left(\frac{nap^2}{nose^2}\right) + \left(\frac{luck^2}{nose^2}\right) & \left(\frac{nap}{nose}\right)\left(\frac{nap}{ear}\right) + \left(\frac{luck}{nose}\right)\left(\frac{luck}{ear}\right) \\
    \left(\frac{nap}{nose}\right)\left(\frac{nap}{ear}\right) + \left(\frac{luck}{nose}\right)\left(\frac{luck}{ear}\right) & \left(\frac{nap^2}{ear^2}\right) + \left(\frac{luck^2}{ear^2}\right) \\
    \end{bmatrix}$
    
    if Ax get nap and luck as new axis, then A^T Ax should have nap and luck as denominators. (nap, luck) is in each row. But what’s numberators? No one knows until after, b/c interpretation is human subjective measured. It’s not absolute. We are guessing they mean nap and luck b/c they correlate with nap and luck. If they correlate with other things that are analogous rise/falls with nap and luck, we can interpret them as those, too. These ratios are NOT inherent to the matrix, which is just a collection of values. Secondly, this is for demo purposes and shouldn’t be extended outside of it. It’s like labeling a target with red tape to see it better during training, the red tape is not going to be part of the wild when you’re hunting with a bow.
    
- Find dimensions of a, b, c, d corresponding to real world values that "make sense" when substituted into A^T * A. For example, a= length, b=color, etc.
    
    [fails]
    

If we treat first row of A^T A as how previous basis compute first new basis vec, then clearly the first row (basis vec) Is nap^2 + luck^2. But unlike when just Ax, A^T Ax uses nose^2 and nose*ear as its previous basis! This also doesn’t make sense because after Ax, those basis vectors should be nap and luck. 

I suppose it only makes sense once you project nap onto those new dims (elements of A^T A), then add them to get the basis elems of A^T A.

Actually this made a mistake; A^T A units don’t act on Ax, so nap and luck shouldn’t be the prev basis vectors. A^T A still acts on x, so nose and ear are still the basis vectors.

What doesn’t make sense is that both basis vectors (both rows) are nap^2 + luck^2, but calculated in 2 different ways (ratios of prev basis). In fact, the mirrored diagonal is the same (nose * ear) while the diagonal is diff (nose^2 vs ear^2 in denominator).

In this case, we must change our perspective if we believe the original basis was ALWAYS “nose” and “ear”- it’s not. It’s ENTIRELY RELATIVE to the matrix! That’s the main lesson in one of the sections of the “why NNs use LA” video. If the matrix was about using “red and blue”, the original wouldn’t be “nose and ear”. So in this case, A^T A ISN’T using nose and ear, but nose^2 and nose*ear for the first, then an entirely different one for the second row!

Yet, the value used for nose^2 and nose*ear is the same (x_1). This is stating that the ratios used to calculate the two are the same in the matrix, despite interpreting as different units.

But if they’re not the same, that is- relative ot the matrix- how can we “carry over” the units upon A^T A? 

Make a separate video for this; don’t put it into your entry for SoME3. Put it as a “quick PSA” that the Some3 links to. This is b/c too much detail, and too controvserial. “Still under investigation” by Yoneda corp. This video doesn’t need geom (besides repeating prev video), just show algebra and “real world ex” units substi in.

This makes sense, still, if instead of substituing nap and etc, we keep a b c d and look at the elemtsn of A^T A. “Don’t do that just yet”. Keep it

But if we allow x_1 and x_2 to be diff units for each row, it no longer makes sense to interpret the denoms as x_1 and x_2. I proporse this instead:

$A^T * A = \begin{bmatrix}
a & c \\
b & d \\
\end{bmatrix} * \begin{bmatrix}
a & b \\
c & d \\
\end{bmatrix}  -> \begin{bmatrix}
\frac{a^2 + c^2}{x_1} & \frac{ab + cd}{x_2} \\
\frac{ab + cd}{x_1} & \frac{b^2 + d^2}{x_2} \\
\end{bmatrix}$

Thus, first row is : $a^2 + c^2 + ab +cd$

Thus, 2nd row is : $b^2 + d^2 + ab +cd$

The ratio units ONLY make sense during MM; they are not inherent to the matrix themselves. 

- Let a = nap/nose, b = nap/ear ; c = luck/nose, d = luck/ear. Substitute these into A * A^T
    
    $A * A^T = \begin{bmatrix}
    \frac{nap}{nose} & \frac{nap}{ear} \\
    \frac{luck}{nose} & \frac{luck}{ear} \\
    \end{bmatrix} * \begin{bmatrix}
    \frac{nap}{nose} & \frac{luck}{nose} \\
    \frac{nap}{ear} & \frac{luck}{ear} \\
    \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
    \left(\frac{nap}{nose}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{nap}{ear}\right)^2 & \left(\frac{nap}{nose}\right)\left(\frac{luck}{nose}\right) + \left(\frac{nap}{ear}\right)\left(\frac{luck}{ear}\right) \\
    \left(\frac{luck}{nose}\right)\left(\frac{nap}{nose}\right) + \left(\frac{luck}{ear}\right)\left(\frac{nap}{ear}\right) & \left(\frac{luck}{nose}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{luck}{ear}\right)^2 \\
    \end{bmatrix}$
    
    Simplify:
    
    $A * A^T = \begin{bmatrix}
    \frac{nap^2}{nose^2} + \frac{nap^2}{ear^2} & \frac{nap \cdot luck}{nose^2} + \frac{nap \cdot luck}{ear^2} \\
    \frac{nap \cdot luck}{nose^2} + \frac{nap \cdot luck}{ear^2} & \frac{luck^2}{nose^2} + \frac{luck^2}{ear^2} \\
    \end{bmatrix}$
    

Propagate ratio units from A to A^T A to eigenvector of A^T A. Show how these, in the end, reconstruct the units for A using USV. This will describe what U and V are doing to “make up” A. And why truncate are most impt.

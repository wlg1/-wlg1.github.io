How much does a transformation stretch/squish “things”?

Originally, basis vectors are on basis (1,0) and (0,1). This is a 1x1 square with area 1. After transformation, we measure the area between the two vectors (treating them as sides of a **parallelogram)** and that’s how much the transformation streches/squishes this unit square. Since the other “shapes” (distances between vectors) in the source vector space are scaled/transformed in a proportional way, this proportion factor also determines how much they are stretched/squished by.

# Jacobian

Q: In laymen's terms, describe how the Jacobian and SVD are related

Jacobian matrix can be decomposed using the SVD into a product of three matrices. The singular values of the Jacobian matrix correspond to the magnitudes of the gradients of the function, and the left-singular and right-singular matrices correspond to the directions of the gradients in the input and output spaces, respectively.

Used for: computing the gradient, determining the stability of a system, or performing dimensionality reduction.

- Given manifolds X and H, what are their tangent space basis vectors?
    
    ![Untitled](Jacobian%20165dd8f2c88b48758e8f2b8878c49db2/Untitled.png)
    
    Note: In a practical context, if you have explicit embeddings of the manifolds into higher-dimensional spaces, you may be able to calculate the tangent vectors directly using vector calculus techniques. But in the abstract setting of differential geometry, the tangent vectors are often introduced via the derivations on the ring of smooth functions, and the basis vectors are introduced as stated above, using local coordinates.
    
- Given a function f from X to H, what is the Jacobian between their tangent spaces? Write out the Jacobian matrix for f: X->H given x1 and x2 as coordiantes of X, and h1 and h2 as coordinates of H.
    
    The Jacobian matrix provides a linear approximation to a function between two manifolds. Specifically, it relates the tangent spaces of the two manifolds at points related by the function.

- What are the coordinates fo a tangent vector in X represented in symbolic form?
    
    ![Untitled](Jacobian%20165dd8f2c88b48758e8f2b8878c49db2/Untitled%2020.png)
    

So the Jacobian is sending [ d/dx1 , d/dx2] into [ d/dh1, d/h2] using J

$\frac{df1}{dx1} = \frac{dh1(p)}{dx1}$ because the tangent space is specific to point p.

- A matrix takes basis vector x,y in space A and transforms them into vector u, v in space B, where u and v are the columns of the matrix. is this true?
    
    Yes. u = Ax and v = Ay.
    
- Given a Jacobian matrix with cols [du/dx, dv/dx] and [du/dy, dv/dy], what are the basis vectors and spaces for this case?
    
    The Jacobian matrix represents how small changes in x and y (the basis vectors of the domain space) affect u and v (in the target space). Specifically, the entry du/dx tells you how much u changes for a small change in x, holding y constant, and similarly for the other entries of the Jacobian matrix.
    
    The columns of the Jacobian matrix represent the rates of change of the functions u(x, y) and v(x, y) with respect to the variables x and y.

The matrix J maps x onto u based on its derivative. In this case, the derivative of 2x is 2.

Now, what if u was a function, say x^2? How can the values of the matrix be variables and still make sense in the geometric interpretation?

J = [du/dx] = [2x]

- if matrices map from linear systems to linear systems, and (x,y) is linear but u is a nonlinear function, how can the Jacobian map to u?
    
    Matrices represent linear transformations, and the concept of linearity refers to two properties: additivity (or superposition) and homogeneity (or scaling). A transformation (or function) is linear if it preserves these two properties.
    
    When we say that a function like u = f(x, y) = x^2 is nonlinear, we're referring to the fact that the function doesn't preserve these properties. For example, f(x + y) is not equal to f(x) + f(y) for this function.
    
    However, when we compute the Jacobian of a function like f(x, y) = x^2, what we're actually doing is approximating the function by a linear function near each point (x, y). That is, we're finding the best linear approximation to the function at each point. This is a process called linearization, and it's central to much of calculus.
    
    The resulting Jacobian matrix then represents a linear transformation that approximates the original nonlinear function near a specific point. This transformation maps small changes in the input variables (x, y) to corresponding changes in the output variable u.
    
- Is dx a linear function? Is it a vector?
    
    The notation "dx" is often used in calculus and it can represent different concepts based on the context, which sometimes can be confusing.
    
    1. Differential: In the context of differential calculus, "dx" can represent a small change or increment in the variable x. For example, in the derivative df/dx, "dx" refers to a small change in x.
    2. Differential operator: "dx" can also be viewed as a differential operator, which when applied to a function gives its derivative.
    3. In the context of integrals, "dx" represents an infinitesimally small width of a rectangle under the curve of a function in a Riemann sum.
    
    "dx" is not a function nor a vector in the traditional sense, but rather it's part of the notation used in calculus to represent the concepts mentioned above.
    
    However, in the context of differential geometry and in certain areas of theoretical physics, differentials like "dx" can be considered as differential 1-forms, which can be thought of as a kind of "vector" in an abstract space, but this is a more advanced topic that goes beyond standard calculus.
    
- Does the Jacobian J=2 given function u =2x map onto the differential 1-form?
    
    In the context of differential geometry, differential 1-forms can be thought of as linear functions that act on vectors. They're a bit different from traditional functions in calculus, as they live in the dual space (space of all linear functionals) to the tangent space at a point on a manifold.
    
    Let's get back to your question: given a function u = 2x, its Jacobian (derivative in this case) is indeed J = 2.
    
    In the language of differential 1-forms, the differential of the function u = 2x is du = 2 dx. The "2 dx" here is a differential 1-form. The number "2" is the coefficient of the differential 1-form, and "dx" is the basis of the space of differential 1-forms.
    
    When you integrate a differential 1-form over a path (or, more generally, when you integrate a differential k-form over a k-dimensional surface), you're adding up the values of the 1-form at each point along the path (or surface). This corresponds to the fundamental theorem of calculus when k = 1.
    
    So, yes, in a certain sense, the Jacobian (derivative) of the function maps onto a differential 1-form, but it's important to keep in mind that these are different mathematical objects that live in different spaces: the function and its derivative are real-valued functions (they map from the real numbers to the real numbers), whereas a differential 1-form is an object in the dual space to the tangent space of a manifold.
    
- are differential forms vectors?
    
    Differential forms are not vectors in the traditional sense. While both vectors and differential forms are mathematical objects used in differential geometry, they have different properties and interpretations.
    
    Vectors, also known as tangent vectors, are geometric objects that represent directions and magnitudes in a vector space. They can be represented by arrays of numbers or arrows in Euclidean space. Vectors can be added, multiplied by scalars, and undergo various operations like dot product and cross product.
    
    On the other hand, differential forms are geometric objects that describe quantities related to orientation, area, volume, and flow. They are closely tied to the concept of differential geometry and calculus. Differential forms can be thought of as objects that assign an antisymmetric array of numbers (or functions) to each point in a manifold. The numbers represent the coefficients of the form, and their antisymmetry captures the notion of orientation.
    
    Differential forms can be multiplied by scalars and undergo operations like wedge product and exterior derivative, which allow for the calculation of integration, differentiation, and other geometric operations.
    
    While vectors and differential forms have different algebraic structures and interpretations, there is a close relationship between them. In fact, given a smooth manifold, the space of differential 1-forms at a point is the dual space of the tangent space at that point. This duality allows for a correspondence between vectors and 1-forms through operations such as the interior product.
    
    In summary, vectors and differential forms are distinct mathematical objects used in differential geometry, but they are related through duality and play complementary roles in describing geometric properties of manifolds.
    
- What is the vector [df1/x, df2/dx, ... dfn/dx]?
    
    The vector you provided, [df₁/dx, df₂/dx, ..., dfₙ/dx], represents the partial derivatives of a function f with respect to the variable x. Each component of the vector corresponds to the partial derivative of f with respect to the respective coordinate variable.
    
    If you have a function f(x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ) defined on an n-dimensional space, the partial derivative df/dx can be calculated by taking the derivative of f with respect to x while keeping all other variables constant. This operation is denoted as ∂f/∂x or df/dx.
    
    The vector [df₁/dx, df₂/dx, ..., dfₙ/dx] captures the rates at which the function f changes along each coordinate direction. It provides information about the sensitivity of the function with respect to changes in the variable x.
    
    It's worth noting that this vector representation assumes that the function f is differentiable and that the partial derivatives exist for each component.
    
- Is there a name or variable for this vector?
    
    Yes, the vector [df₁/dx, df₂/dx, ..., dfₙ/dx] can be referred to as the gradient of the function f with respect to the variable x. It is commonly denoted as ∇f or grad(f).
    
    The gradient is a fundamental concept in vector calculus and differential geometry. It represents the vector field that points in the direction of the steepest ascent of the function f at each point in its domain. The magnitude of the gradient vector corresponds to the rate of change or the slope of the function in that direction.
    
    The gradient vector has applications in various fields, including optimization, physics, computer science, and engineering. It provides valuable information about the behavior of functions and is often used to solve problems related to finding extrema, optimizing functions, and solving differential equations.
    
- Is the gradient a differential form?
    
    The gradient is not a differential form in the strict sense. Differential forms are mathematical objects that assign antisymmetric arrays of numbers or functions to each point in a manifold. They capture information about orientation, area, volume, and flow.
    
    On the other hand, the gradient is a vector field, which is a collection of vectors defined at each point in a space. In the context of vector calculus, the gradient represents the vector field associated with the partial derivatives of a scalar function. It points in the direction of the steepest ascent of the function and has both magnitude and direction.
    
    While the gradient is not a differential form itself, there is a connection between them. In differential geometry, the exterior derivative of a 0-form (a function) gives rise to a 1-form (a differential form). The gradient of a scalar function can be seen as a 1-form in this context. It is the 1-form that, when contracted with a tangent vector (vector field), gives the directional derivative of the function along that vector.
    
    So, while the gradient is not a differential form in its own right, it has a relationship to differential forms through the concept of exterior derivatives and the duality between vectors and 1-forms.
    
- Is the gradient a vector?
    
    Yes, the gradient is a vector. In the context of vector calculus, the gradient is a vector field that represents the vector pointing in the direction of the steepest ascent of a scalar function at each point in space.
    
    For a scalar function f(x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ), the gradient is denoted as ∇f or grad(f). It is defined as a vector with components given by the partial derivatives of the function with respect to each coordinate variable:
    
    ∇f = (df/dx₁, df/dx₂, ..., df/dxₙ).
    
    The gradient vector has both magnitude and direction. Its magnitude represents the rate of change or the slope of the function in the direction of steepest ascent, and its direction points in that direction. The gradient provides information about how the function varies as you move through the space.
    
    The gradient is an important concept in calculus, optimization, and physics. It is commonly used to find extrema of functions, solve optimization problems, calculate directional derivatives, and solve differential equations.
    
- How can the gradient be both a vector and a vector field?
    
    I apologize for any confusion caused by my previous response. To clarify, the gradient is a vector field, not a single vector.
    
    A vector field is a collection of vectors defined at each point in a space. In the case of the gradient, it is a vector field that associates a vector with each point in the domain of a scalar function. Each vector in the gradient field points in the direction of the steepest ascent of the function at the corresponding point.
    
    So, while the gradient is not a single vector, it is a vector field that assigns a vector to each point in space. Each vector in the field represents the direction and magnitude of the steepest ascent of the function at that point.
    
    In summary, the gradient is a vector field consisting of vectors that represent the direction of the steepest ascent of a scalar function at each point in space.

The gradient AT A POINT P is a tangent vector. 

- Is the gradient at a point a tangent vector, but the gradient of a function (whose domain are points) a vector field?
    
    Yes, that is correct. The gradient at a point is a tangent vector, while the gradient of a function is a vector field.
    
    At a specific point in the domain of a scalar function, the gradient represents a tangent vector. It is a vector that is tangent to the level set of the function at that point, pointing in the direction of steepest ascent of the function at that location. The magnitude of the gradient vector corresponds to the rate of change or the slope of the function in that direction.
    
    On the other hand, the gradient of a function is a vector field. It is a collection of tangent vectors assigned to each point in the domain of the function. The gradient vector field maps each point to its corresponding tangent vector, providing a continuous distribution of vectors throughout the domain. This vector field captures the directions and magnitudes of the steepest ascent of the function at each point.
    
    So, to summarize, the gradient at a point is a tangent vector representing the direction of steepest ascent at that specific location, while the gradient of a function is a vector field that assigns a tangent vector to each point in the domain of the function.
    
- So are the basis vectors of the jacobian at a point the tangent vectors at that point, given gradients for each function?
    
    No, the basis vectors of the Jacobian matrix at a point are not the same as the tangent vectors at that point given gradients for each function.
    
    Let's clarify the concepts:
    
    1. Tangent vectors: Tangent vectors represent directions in the tangent space at a specific point on a manifold. They describe local directions and changes at that point. Tangent vectors are often used in differential geometry to study the geometry of manifolds.
    2. Gradients: Gradients, as we discussed earlier, are vectors that represent the direction of steepest ascent of a scalar function at a specific point. They provide information about the rate of change of the function in different directions.
    3. Jacobian matrix: The Jacobian matrix is a matrix that represents the partial derivatives of a vector-valued function with respect to its independent variables. It is used to linearize and study the local behavior of a vector-valued function around a point.
    
    Now, to address your question: The basis vectors of the Jacobian matrix at a point are not the same as the tangent vectors at that point given gradients for each function. The Jacobian matrix provides information about the linear approximation of a vector-valued function near a point, while tangent vectors describe the local directions and changes at a point.
    
    The tangent vectors at a point are typically obtained from a tangent basis of the manifold, such as a coordinate basis or an orthonormal basis derived from a metric structure. These tangent vectors are not directly related to the gradients of the individual functions involved in the Jacobian matrix.
    
    In summary, the basis vectors of the Jacobian matrix represent the partial derivatives of a vector-valued function, while the tangent vectors represent directions and changes at a specific point on a manifold. They are distinct concepts with different interpretations and uses in differential geometry and calculus.
    
- So are the basis vectors from the domain are mapped by the Jacobian to the tangent vectors at that point, given gradients for each function?
    
    Yes, that is correct. The basis vectors from the domain, when mapped by the Jacobian matrix, can provide a set of tangent vectors at a specific point.
    
    When you have a vector-valued function defined on a manifold, the Jacobian matrix represents the linear transformation between the tangent spaces of the domain and the target space. The columns of the Jacobian matrix correspond to the partial derivatives of the components of the vector-valued function with respect to the coordinates of the domain.
    
    If you consider a point in the domain of the vector-valued function, the basis vectors of the domain, when multiplied by the Jacobian matrix, yield the tangent vectors at that point in the target space. These tangent vectors represent the directions and rates of change of the function at that specific point.
    
    In other words, the columns of the Jacobian matrix can be viewed as the tangent vectors in the target space associated with the basis vectors of the domain. The Jacobian matrix provides a way to map the tangent vectors from the domain to the tangent vectors in the target space at a given point.
    
    So, to summarize, the Jacobian matrix allows you to relate the basis vectors of the domain to the tangent vectors at a specific point by providing a linear transformation between the tangent spaces.
    
- When we say "basis vectors at that domain", are we treating the point as the origin of the domain?
    
    No, when we refer to the "basis vectors at that domain," we are not treating the point as the origin of the domain. The basis vectors of the domain are independent vectors that span the tangent space at a given point on the manifold.
    
    In the context of a differentiable manifold, the tangent space at a point represents all possible tangent vectors that can be attached to that point. The tangent space is a vector space, and it has a basis consisting of independent tangent vectors.
    
    The basis vectors at a point in the domain do not assume that the point is the origin of the domain. Rather, they provide a set of linearly independent directions that span the tangent space at that point. These basis vectors can be chosen to be any independent set of tangent vectors, such as a coordinate basis or a basis derived from a metric structure.
    
    The choice of basis vectors may depend on the specific application or coordinate system used, but it is important to note that the basis vectors do not assume the point to be the origin of the domain. They simply provide a local set of directions that span the tangent space at that point.
    

basis vectors from the domain are mapped by the Jacobian to the tangent vectors at that point

Jacobian with 1 column is m x 1. Point is 1x1 (each col of input is an observation, so 1 obs is 1 col). Thus, output is mx1, which is an m-dim vector.

- Why is a jacobian used to define a linear map bewten two tangent spaces at two points in separates spaces?
    
    The Jacobian matrix is used to define a linear map between two tangent spaces at two points in separate spaces because it provides a way to approximate the local behavior of a smooth map near a given point.
    
    Consider two manifolds, each with their own tangent spaces, and a smooth map that connects points on these manifolds. When you have a map between these manifolds, the Jacobian matrix represents the linearization of that map at a particular point.
    
    The Jacobian matrix captures the derivatives of the components of the map with respect to the coordinates of the domain. By evaluating the Jacobian matrix at a specific point, you obtain a linear map between the tangent spaces of the two manifolds at that point.
    
    This linear map serves as an approximation of the map's behavior near the point of evaluation. It provides a linear relationship between the tangent vectors at the two points, allowing you to study how vectors in the tangent space at one point relate to vectors in the tangent space at another point.
    
    By considering the Jacobian matrix, you can analyze properties such as local linearity, differentiability, and how the map distorts or preserves lengths and angles locally. It provides a tool to understand the relationship between tangent spaces at different points on separate manifolds.
    
    In summary, the Jacobian matrix is used to define a linear map between tangent spaces at two points in separate spaces to approximate the local behavior of a smooth map and study the relationship between tangent vectors at different points.
    
- Let f be a map between spaces X and H, each with multiple dims. So we have f(x) = h. This means we have dh/dx. This is one function. But a Jacobian’s cols each represent a function. Would the Jacobian be one col? Or would it be multiple cols because each dim of h is considered a separate function?
    
    In the scenario you described, where you have a map f from a space X to a space H, with f(x) = h, the Jacobian matrix will typically have multiple columns. Each column of the Jacobian matrix represents the partial derivatives of the components of the map with respect to the coordinates of the domain.
    
    Let's break it down:
    
    - X: The space X represents the domain of the map f. It can have multiple dimensions, denoted as x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ.
    - H: The space H represents the target space of the map f. It can also have multiple dimensions, denoted as h₁, h₂, ..., hₘ.
    - f(x) = h: This equation represents the map f that takes a point x in the domain and maps it to a point h in the target space.
    
    Now, the Jacobian matrix represents the linearization of the map f at a particular point in the domain. Since both the domain X and the target space H can have multiple dimensions, the Jacobian matrix will have multiple columns, with each column corresponding to the partial derivatives of the components of h with respect to the components of x.
    
    For example, if X is an n-dimensional space and H is an m-dimensional space, the Jacobian matrix will have m columns, and each column will represent the partial derivatives of the components of h with respect to each component of x. Therefore, the Jacobian matrix will have dimensions m × n.
    
    To summarize, in the scenario you described, the Jacobian matrix will typically have multiple columns, representing the partial derivatives of the components of the target space H with respect to the components of the domain X.
    

So the Jacobian sends points from x into points in h. However, the basis used for h are the tangent vectors in the tangent space. This is the case for EVERY Jacobian matrix; it was never using the basis vector of (x,y) in the first place, but (dx, dy) !

- Are tangent vectors the basis vectors in a tangent space?
    
    Yes, in a tangent space, the tangent vectors form a basis for that space.
    
    In the context of differential geometry, a tangent space is associated with each point on a manifold. The tangent space at a point represents all possible tangent vectors that can be attached to that point. Tangent vectors in the tangent space describe local directions and changes at that point.
    
    A basis for the tangent space is a set of tangent vectors that are linearly independent and span the entire tangent space. This means that any tangent vector in the tangent space can be expressed as a linear combination of the basis vectors.
    
    The tangent vectors in the basis provide a framework for describing directions and changes in the local neighborhood of a point on the manifold. They play a crucial role in understanding the geometry and differential calculus on the manifold.
    
    So, in summary, tangent vectors form the basis for the tangent space at each point on a manifold. They provide a set of linearly independent directions that span the tangent space and enable the study of local behavior and calculus on the manifold.
    

Now, the Jacobian goes from basis vector in T_x(I), a tangent space, to another tangent space. Each basis in T_h is $dh_1 = [dh_1 / dx_1, dh_1 / dx_2, …]$. These are the rows.

HOWEVER, each basis vector from T_x is sent, instead, to the cols $[dh_1 / dx_1, dh_2 / dx_1 …]$. This new vector in T_h represents the measurement of dx for each dh. It is the projection of dx onto each dh_i (or the other way around?)

Thus, we know what basis elements the Jacobian acts on and sends to: from one tangent space to another. This means the functions are not basis vectors at these spaces; the tangent vectors at a point of the function are.

Next, what’s the singular vectors of this Jacobian? These vectors are in tangent space, and are rotated onto another tangent space. Remember, vectors are not fixed to a point, but can be moved around. They are characterized by direction and length. This means a tangent space (set of vectors) at one place is equivalent to a tangent space at another; it is NOT fixed onto the manifold, but external to it.

- is this true?
    
    Yes, you are correct. Tangent spaces are not fixed onto the manifold but are external to it. Tangent spaces exist independently of the manifold and can be defined at each point on the manifold.
    
    Tangent spaces are vector spaces that capture the local properties of the manifold at a specific point. They consist of tangent vectors that represent directions and changes at that point. Tangent vectors are characterized by their direction and length but are not tied to a particular point on the manifold.
    
    Importantly, tangent spaces are defined consistently across the manifold. The tangent space at one point is equivalent to the tangent space at another point. This equivalence arises from the fact that tangent spaces are constructed based on the local behavior of the manifold, and their definitions are independent of any specific point.
    
    Tangent spaces provide a way to study the geometry and differential calculus on the manifold. By considering tangent vectors and tangent spaces, we can understand the local directions, rates of change, and other geometric properties of the manifold at each point.
    
    In summary, tangent spaces are external to the manifold, and their definitions are consistent across the manifold. They capture local properties and consist of tangent vectors that describe directions and changes. Tangent spaces play a crucial role in understanding the geometry and differential calculus on the manifold.

This useful video still doesn’t explain Jacobian mapping from tangent space to tangent space based on matrix interpretation. Nor do a lot of books. In fact, on the web, this is stated somewhere, but it is not easily found nor intuitively, visually shown. It’s just implied and known.

So stating that we are using dx as basis vectors of tangent space, and using jacobian to send them to $\nabla_x h$ (a vector in $T_h$ ) is novel bc of how directly, explicitly stated, to-the-point it is, instead of being inferred and implied after studying the subject.

Now, the singular vectors of the Jacobian transform T_x into T_h. We transform T_x by a rotation, scaling, then rotation again.

Jv = USV^Tv = US, because V^T v = identity

Are the right singular vectors from the domain vector space, and the left singular vectors in the target vector space?

Don’t interpret it this way.

V would place basis onto right singular vector. But V^-1 = V^T places right singular onto basis. The original basis are not named here.

So we go from original basis, and always end up at left singular vectors.

Ax = lamb*x

Jv = sigma*u

In the case of Jv, it is not doing anything to v. Rather, it is stretching u. This is because V^T v “negates” v by just focusing on the basis vectors. It stretches the basis, then rotates. That’s it. 

However, Jp, for any vector p, projects x onto V, the right singular vectors. it  interprets p in terms of the right singular vectors- for instance, if the mat was Jacobian and right singular were vectors (not necc tangents) such as “nap”, it interprets p in those terms. It stretches it by “nap”, then rotates by u. This requires v, b/c we are not scaling the original basis (in j, it’s d/dx), but scaling the right singular vectors. 

In the case of the Jacobian, the original basis vectors are the tangent vectors d/dx, etc! 

- The right singular vectors are the eigenvectors of A^T A. For Jacobian, it’s $J^T J$. What’s the interpretation of this matrix product in terms of derivatives and forms?
    
    The matrix product A^T A, where A is the Jacobian matrix, has a specific interpretation in terms of derivatives and forms. Let's explore it further.
    
    The Jacobian matrix J represents the derivative of a vector-valued function. Suppose you have a function F: ℝ^n → ℝ^m, and you evaluate the Jacobian matrix J at a specific point x₀ in the domain of F. Then J is an m×n matrix, where each entry represents the partial derivative of the corresponding component of F with respect to the variables in the domain.
    
    Now, let's consider the matrix product J^T J. Here, J^T denotes the transpose of the Jacobian matrix. The resulting matrix J^T J is an n×n matrix.
    
    The interpretation of J^T J in terms of derivatives and forms relates to the concept of the Hessian matrix, which is a generalization of the second derivative of a scalar-valued function to multivariable functions.
    
    For a scalar-valued function f: ℝ^n → ℝ, the Hessian matrix is given by the matrix of second partial derivatives of f. If we denote the Hessian matrix as H, then the elements of H are defined as:
    
    H(i, j) = ∂²f/∂xᵢ∂xⱼ
    
    Now, suppose we have a vector-valued function F: ℝ^n → ℝ^m. The matrix product J^T J has a similar interpretation as the Hessian matrix but for vector-valued functions.
    
    The (i, j)-th element of J^T J represents the dot product of the column vectors in the Jacobian matrix associated with the i-th and j-th variables. In other words, it captures the interaction between the partial derivatives of the vector components of F with respect to the i-th and j-th variables.
    
    Therefore, the matrix product J^T J can be seen as a generalization of the Hessian matrix to vector-valued functions. It encodes information about the interactions and dependencies between the partial derivatives of the vector components with respect to different variables, providing insights into the curvature and geometry of the function in the domain.
    

- is the hessian matrix the product of jacobian with its transpose?
    
    No, the Hessian matrix is not the product of the Jacobian matrix with its transpose. The Hessian matrix is a square matrix of second partial derivatives of a scalar-valued function, while the Jacobian matrix is a matrix of partial derivatives of a vector-valued function.
    
    The Hessian matrix H of a scalar-valued function f: ℝ^n → ℝ is defined as an n×n matrix with elements:
    
    H(i, j) = ∂²f/∂xᵢ∂xⱼ
    
    Each element of the Hessian matrix represents the second partial derivative of the function f with respect to the variables xᵢ and xⱼ.
    
    On the other hand, the Jacobian matrix J is used for vector-valued functions. If you have a vector-valued function F: ℝ^n → ℝ^m, the Jacobian matrix J is an m×n matrix whose elements are the partial derivatives of the components of F with respect to the variables in the domain.
    
    The product of the Jacobian matrix J with its transpose J^T gives an m×m matrix, which is not equivalent to the Hessian matrix. The product J^T J is often used in optimization and regression problems to compute the normal equations or as a measure of curvature, but it is not the same as the Hessian matrix.
    

- Calculate product J^T J
    
    
- what is the product of two derivatives? can you multiply dh/dx * dh/dx?
    
    Apologies for the confusion. The product of two derivatives, such as dh/dx * dh/dx, is known as the second derivative or the derivative of the derivative.
    
    If you have a function h(x) and you take the derivative of h(x) with respect to x, denoted as dh/dx, you obtain the first derivative. Taking the derivative again yields the second derivative, which can be denoted as d²h/dx² or (dh/dx)².
    
    However, it is important to note that the expression (dh/dx)² does not represent the multiplication of two separate derivatives dh/dx * dh/dx. Instead, it represents the square of the first derivative, which is the second derivative.
    
    In summary, the product of two derivatives, such as dh/dx * dh/dx, is commonly understood as the square of the first derivative, which is the second derivative of the function h(x).
    

Therapist says: J^T J, unfortunately, has no clear interpretation (write its elements out) “that I know of, though perhaps someone else does”.

- What is dh/dx * dh/dx + dh/dy * dh/dx called? What is it similar to?
    
    The expression dh/dx * dh/dx + dh/dy * dh/dx is called the mixed second partial derivative of the function h(x, y) with respect to x.
    
    It is similar to the concept of the Hessian matrix, which represents the matrix of second partial derivatives of a function. The Hessian matrix is often denoted as H and has elements H(i, j) = ∂²h/∂xᵢ∂xⱼ.
    
    In the given expression, the terms dh/dx * dh/dx and dh/dy * dh/dx correspond to the second partial derivatives of h(x, y) with respect to x. More specifically:
    
    - dh/dx * dh/dx represents (∂h/∂x)², which is the second partial derivative of h with respect to x.
    - dh/dy * dh/dx represents (∂h/∂y)(∂h/∂x), which is the mixed partial derivative of h with respect to x and y.
    
    Therefore, the expression dh/dx * dh/dx + dh/dy * dh/dx is a combination of the second partial derivative of h with respect to x and the mixed partial derivative of h with respect to x and y. It captures the interaction and dependence of the function h(x, y) on both x and y, providing information about the curvature and variations of the function with respect to these variables.

J^T J is square, but not easily interpretable. To know what right singular are, we must know what J^T J is because right singular are its eigenvectors.

Our aim is to find u such that:

![Untitled](Jacobian%20165dd8f2c88b48758e8f2b8878c49db2/Untitled%2024.png)

1. Get v from A^T A
2. Now rearrange. Then we just need to find a way to calculate U. We SEPARATELY calculate u using the eigenvectors of A A^T

Imagine A has dims nap and red. Then A^T A has first elem nap*nap + nap*nose. nap*nose is a projection? No. Think of it in terms of units.

nap/nose * nap/nose = nap^2 / nose^2 . This is saying how many times squared nap goes into squared nose. It projects nose^2 onto nap^2. This not interpretable, esp when added with other things.

So for now we should end trying to “interpret” eigenvectors of A^T A in terms of the basis vectors of A (eg if they represented nap), and thus right singular vectors. Instead, just treat them on a surface level and say why we use them, and how to derive them.

Thus showing each unit vector is a derivative.

- What is dx? A vector?
    
    In the context of calculus, "dx" typically represents an infinitesimal change or differential of the variable x. It is not a vector in this context.
    
    "dx" is often used as part of an integral to indicate the variable of integration or as part of a derivative to represent the variable with respect to which differentiation is being performed. It is commonly treated as an infinitesimally small quantity.
    
    In some advanced mathematical contexts, such as differential forms in differential geometry, "dx" can be interpreted as a 1-form, which is a mathematical object that assigns a value to each tangent vector at a point. In this context, "dx" represents a covector or a dual vector.
    
    However, in basic calculus and most common applications, "dx" is not treated as a vector. It is used primarily to indicate the variable with respect to which integration or differentiation is performed and to help construct integrals or derivatives.
    
- Is dx a tangent vector?
    
    In the context of calculus, "dx" by itself is not considered a tangent vector. Instead, it is commonly used to represent an infinitesimal change or differential of the variable x.
    
    In differential geometry, tangent vectors are associated with points on a manifold and represent directions and changes at those points. They are vectors that belong to the tangent space at a specific point.
    
    While "dx" is not inherently a tangent vector, it can be used to define tangent vectors in certain contexts. For example, if you have a parametric curve in a manifold defined by functions x(t) and y(t), the tangent vector at a point can be expressed as a linear combination of the derivatives dx/dt and dy/dt.
    
    So, while "dx" alone is not typically considered a tangent vector, it can be used alongside other differentials or derivatives to construct tangent vectors in specific situations.

- what notation is used to represent tangent vectors as basis in a tangent space?
    
    In differential geometry, the notation commonly used to represent tangent vectors as a basis in a tangent space depends on the context and the choice of coordinate systems or indices.
    
    Here are a few commonly used notations:
    
    1. Coordinate Basis: In a coordinate basis, the tangent vectors are typically denoted as partial derivatives with respect to the coordinate variables. For example, in a two-dimensional space, the tangent vectors can be written as (dx/dx₁, dx/dx₂) or (∂/∂x₁, ∂/∂x₂), where x₁ and x₂ are the coordinate variables.
    2. Index Notation: In index notation, tangent vectors can be represented using indices. For example, in a three-dimensional space, a tangent vector can be denoted as Vᵢ, where i takes values from 1 to 3. The index notation allows for concise representation of tangent vectors and simplifies operations such as contraction and raising/lowering indices using the metric tensor.
    3. Abstract Index Notation: In abstract index notation, tangent vectors are represented using abstract indices, such as Vₐ, Vₘ, etc. The abstract index notation is a more formal representation that abstracts away the specific coordinate systems and emphasizes the geometric and algebraic properties of tangent vectors.
    
    It's important to note that these notations are just conventions, and different sources or authors may use slightly different notations based on their preference or the specific context of the discussion. The choice of notation may also depend on the level of formality and mathematical rigor being employed.
    
    In any case, the notation used should be clear and consistent within the given context to properly represent the tangent vectors as a basis in a tangent space.

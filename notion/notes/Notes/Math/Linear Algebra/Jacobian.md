# Jacobian

Q: In laymen's terms, describe how the Jacobian and SVD are related

Jacobian matrix can be decomposed using the SVD into a product of three matrices. The singular values of the Jacobian matrix correspond to the magnitudes of the gradients of the function, and the left-singular and right-singular matrices correspond to the directions of the gradients in the input and output spaces, respectively.

Used for: computing the gradient, determining the stability of a system, or performing dimensionality reduction.

# Triangular Forms

Q: Why does Triangular forms solve system of linear equations?

A: Triangular means there are rows of variables consecutively from 1 to n. When solving a system of equations, you need to start with at least one known variable. Then, in the second equation, all variables must be known except for one. In the third one, the same principle applies.

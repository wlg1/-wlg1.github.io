# Affine

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_transformation)

a [geometric transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_transformation) that preserves [lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_(geometry)) and [parallelism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallelism_(geometry)) (if a line is parallel to another or not), but not necessarily [Euclidean distances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance) and [angles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle).

Unlike a purely linear transformation, an affine transformation need not preserve the origin of the affine space. Thus, every linear transformation is affine, but not every affine transformation is linear. Linear $\sub$ Affine

Affine cannot be nonlinear, and vice versa. So they are in separate sets (disjoint).

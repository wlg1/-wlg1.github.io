# Singular Values

- What’s the relation between singular values and eigenvalues?
    
    Consider the singular value decomposition (SVD) of a matrix A:
    
    $$
    A = UΣV^T
    $$
    
    where U and V are orthogonal matrices, and Σ is a diagonal matrix with non-negative singular values arranged in descending order. The rank of A is equal to the number of non-zero singular values of A.
    
    Now, consider the eigendecomposition of the matrix $A^TA$ (which is square):
    
    $$
    A^TA = VΛV^T
    $$
    
    where V is an orthogonal matrix of eigenvectors of $A^TA$, and Λ is a diagonal matrix of eigenvalues of $A^TA$, which are all non-negative, and they are equal to the squares of the singular values of A.

    Thus, the number of non-zero singular values of A is equal to the number of non-zero eigenvalues of $A^TA$, which is equal to the rank of A. 
    
    Note that this relationship holds for any matrix A, not just square matrices. In general, if A is an m x n matrix with rank r, then the non-zero singular values and non-zero eigenvalues of A^TA and AA^T are the same, and their number is equal to r.
    
- singular vs eigenvalues diff?
    
    Singular values and eigenvalues are both important mathematical quantities associated with matrices, but they have different properties and interpretations.
    
    Eigenvalues are a set of scalars that describe how a matrix transforms a vector. Specifically, an eigenvector is a nonzero vector that is transformed by the matrix into a scalar multiple of itself, and the corresponding scalar factor is called the eigenvalue. Eigenvalues are always complex numbers and can be used to determine important properties of a matrix, such as its determinant, trace, and invertibility.
    
    Singular values, on the other hand, are related to the singular value decomposition (SVD) of a matrix, which is a factorization of the matrix into three matrices that describes its properties. The singular values of a matrix are the square roots of the eigenvalues of the matrix's Hermitian (conjugate transpose) product with itself. The singular values provide information about the rank and geometry of the matrix and can be used in a variety of applications, such as image processing and data compression.
    
    In summary, eigenvalues describe how a matrix transforms a vector, while singular values are related to the SVD of a matrix and provide information about its rank and geometry.

- Explain left and right singular vectors intuitively using analogies, giving an interpretation of them using a simple real world example
    
    In linear algebra, singular vectors are a key concept in the study of matrices. A matrix can be thought of as a transformation that maps one set of vectors to another set of vectors. Singular vectors are special vectors that, when multiplied by the matrix, are transformed only by a scalar factor, which is known as the singular value. The left singular vectors and the right singular vectors are two sets of vectors that are associated with the singular values of a matrix.
    
    To give you an intuitive understanding of left and right singular vectors, let's consider an example of a person who wants to learn how to play a musical instrument, such as a guitar. The person has a set of songs that they want to learn, and they want to be able to play them well.
    
    In this analogy, we can think of the songs as the vectors that the person wants to transform. The person's goal is to be able to play the songs as accurately as possible. To achieve this, the person needs to learn the chords and techniques that are used in the songs.
    
    Now let's think of the chords and techniques as the matrix that represents the transformation. The matrix takes the songs (vectors) and transforms them into the sound that the person plays on the guitar.
    
    The left singular vectors represent the chords and techniques that the person needs to learn to play the songs well. These vectors are the ones that, when multiplied by the matrix, result in a scalar factor that represents the amount of influence that the chord or technique has on the song. In other words, the left singular vectors represent the most important factors that influence the sound of the songs.
    
    The right singular vectors represent the songs themselves. These vectors are the ones that, when multiplied by the matrix, are transformed into the sound that the person plays on the guitar. In other words, the right singular vectors represent the set of songs that the person wants to learn.
    
    So, in summary, the left singular vectors represent the chords and techniques that are most important for transforming the songs, while the right singular vectors represent the set of songs that the person wants to learn. By understanding these concepts, the person can learn the chords and techniques that are most important for playing the songs well.

- Is differential geometry noneuclidean
    
    Yes, differential geometry encompasses the study of curved spaces, which are often referred to as non-Euclidean spaces. Unlike Euclidean geometry, which deals with flat, straight-line geometry in a plane or in three-dimensional space, differential geometry extends the concepts of geometry to curved surfaces and higher-dimensional manifolds.
    
    In Euclidean geometry, the fundamental postulate is the parallel postulate, which states that through a given point, there exists only one line parallel to a given line. However, in non-Euclidean geometries, such as spherical geometry and hyperbolic geometry, the parallel postulate does not hold. The curvature of the space affects the behavior of lines, angles, and distances.
    
    Differential geometry provides a framework for studying and understanding these curved spaces mathematically. It uses tools from calculus, linear algebra, and topology to analyze the properties of curves, surfaces, and manifolds. By introducing concepts like curvature, geodesics (shortest paths), and Riemannian metrics, differential geometry allows for a comprehensive study of geometric structures that deviate from the flat geometry of Euclidean space.
    
    Therefore, differential geometry goes beyond Euclidean geometry by accommodating non-Euclidean geometries, enabling the investigation of curved spaces and providing a rich mathematical framework for understanding their properties and relationships.

Find linear map for curved surfaces

Stereographic projection allows 1-1 from map to globe. Use 2 maps to get north and south pole. Since they have a lot of overlap, this allows smooth transition b/w 2 maps. These maps form an atlas.

Order of dx and dy in dx (dy) matters, unlike in a cartesian plane, which forms a rectangle (commutative).

2-form (two 1-forms): returns a scalar that’s the projection of 2 tangent vectors onto the area (determinant) of 2-form vectors

0-form: pt at a fn (?)

Exterior derivatives: tendency for where an object will rotate if placed on that pt (curl)

Ext deriv at a pt at a fn: returns a 1-form that points to where change is the fastest

Ext deriv of 2-form: how far water moves away from a single pt (why just single if 2?) This is divergence

Thus, ‘direc deriv’, curl and div are all just ext derivs

12m: integrating the direction in each ‘local area’ gives direction of flow in ‘global area’. Stokes’ thm

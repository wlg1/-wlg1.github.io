# Hermitian operator

In simple terms, what is Hermitian (conjugate transpose) ?

The Hermitian (conjugate transpose) of a matrix is a new matrix obtained by taking the transpose of the matrix and then taking the complex conjugate of each element.

The transpose of a matrix is obtained by swapping its rows and columns, while the complex conjugate of a number is obtained by changing the sign of its imaginary part. Therefore, the Hermitian of a matrix effectively reflects it across its main diagonal and changes the sign of all its complex elements.

The Hermitian of a matrix is important in many areas of mathematics, physics, and engineering, as it is closely related to the concept of an adjoint operator, which is used to describe the behavior of linear operators in a complex vector space. In particular, the Hermitian of a matrix plays a key role in the spectral theory of matrices, as it is used to define the notion of a Hermitian matrix, which is a special type of matrix with important properties, including real eigenvalues and orthogonal eigenvectors.

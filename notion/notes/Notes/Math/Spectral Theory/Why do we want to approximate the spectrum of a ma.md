# Why do we want to approximate the spectrum of a matrix?

The spectrum of a matrix refers to the set of all its eigenvalues,

In finance, the eigenvalues of a covariance matrix can be used to determine the risk associated with a portfolio of assets.

However, in many cases, it is not feasible or practical to compute the exact eigenvalues of a large or complex matrix.

For example, spectral approximation techniques can be used to analyze the stability of a dynamical system, to compute the dominant eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix, to compress data using matrix factorization

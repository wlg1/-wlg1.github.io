Basic topology questions

- Why do open set properties of say union etc equivalent to saying all points within some threshold
    
    The concept of open sets and operations like unions among them being equivalent to saying "all points within some threshold" ties back to the foundational ideas in topology, a branch of mathematics that studies properties of space that are preserved under continuous transformations. Open sets are one of the key notions in this area, providing a way to formalize the idea of "closeness" without necessarily relying on a specific metric or distance function.
    
    ### Open Sets
    
    An **open set** in a topological space is a set that, for every point in the set, includes a surrounding neighborhood entirely contained within the set. The precise definition of a "neighborhood" can vary depending on the context, such as Euclidean space where it often means all points within a certain distance (the "threshold" you mentioned) from a given point.
    
    ### Operations Like Union
    
    When we talk about operations like the **union** of open sets, we're referring to the combination of two or more open sets to form another set. The union of open sets is itself open because, for any point in any of the original sets, there's a neighborhood around that point lying completely within one of the original sets, and therefore within the union. This means if you're at any point in the union, you're within the threshold distance of being entirely within at least one of the original open sets.
    
    ### Equivalence to "All Points Within Some Threshold"
    
    This equivalence arises from the definition of open sets in metric spaces, which are a type of topological space. In a metric space, an open set can be characterized as one where, for any point in the set, there exists some radius (i.e., threshold) such that all points within that radius from the point are also in the set. This radius varies from point to point but ensures that the set does not include its boundary.
    
    ### Summary
    
    The idea of open set operations being equivalent to saying "all points within some threshold" is a reflection of how topology captures notions of "closeness" and "withinness" in a very general way. This framework allows for the study of continuous deformations and other properties that are independent of the exact shapes or sizes of objects, focusing instead on more fundamental properties of space itself.
    
- So the proof for union is threshold is max of the two? Why is this not proven and is an axiom? Can you show these axiomatic definitions for others are equivalent to defining closeness?
    
    The intuition behind open sets and their operations in topology is not strictly about finding a "maximum threshold" for a union of sets, as you would in some metric-specific contexts. Rather, topology provides a more flexible and abstract framework for understanding concepts of closeness and continuity without depending solely on numerical distances. Let's clarify a few points:
    
    ### Open Sets and Unions
    
    In topology, an **open set** is a set where, for every point within the set, there exists a "neighborhood" entirely contained within the set. This neighborhood concept abstractly represents "closeness" without specifying distances.
    
    When we take the **union** of open sets, the resulting set is open because, for any point in any of the original open sets, there is already a neighborhood around that point contained within that original set, and therefore in the union as well. The concept of "maximum threshold" does not directly apply here because we're not always working with a specific measure of distance; rather, we're working with the idea that there is some neighborhood, however defined, around every point in the set.
    
    ### Axiomatic Foundations
    
    In topology, the properties of open sets (including how unions of open sets are themselves open) are part of the **axioms of a topological space** rather than something proven from more fundamental principles. These axioms are:
    
    1. **The empty set and the whole space are open.**
    2. **Any union of open sets is open.** This axiom directly states the property you're asking about and is taken as a foundational principle rather than something derived.
    3. **The intersection of any finite number of open sets is open.**
    
    These axioms are chosen because they capture the essence of "closeness" and continuity in a very general and flexible manner, applicable to a wide variety of mathematical contexts, not just those where distances can be measured.
    
    ### Equivalence to Defining Closeness
    
    The axiomatic approach to topology is equivalent to defining closeness in a more abstract sense than distances. In metric spaces (a type of topological space where distances can be measured), the concept of open sets and neighborhoods does indeed often translate to "all points within some distance (threshold)." However, in general topology, "closeness" is captured without relying on distances, using neighborhoods and open sets to talk about points being "close" in a more qualitative sense.
    
    ### Summary
    
    The axioms of topology, including those related to open sets and their operations, provide a foundational framework to discuss concepts like continuity and closeness in very general settings. These axioms are not proven within the framework of topology itself but are the basis from which topological properties are derived. They allow mathematicians to study spaces and functions in a highly abstract and flexible way, which can then be applied across many areas of mathematics and related fields.
    
- Is a neighborhood an open set
    
    In topology, a **neighborhood** of a point is a concept that intuitively represents the idea of "closeness" around that point. The precise definition can vary slightly depending on the context within mathematics, but it generally refers to a set that includes an open set containing the point in question. So, while a neighborhood itself is not required to be an open set by definition, it must contain an open set that includes the point of interest.
    
    ### Neighborhood in General Topology
    
    In general topology, a neighborhood of a point \(x\) in a topological space is any set \(V\) containing \(x\) such that there exists an open set \(U\) with \(x \in U \subseteq V\). This means every neighborhood of a point \(x\) contains an open set that also contains \(x\), but the neighborhood itself can be more inclusive than this open set. Thus, a neighborhood may or may not be open.
    
    ### Neighborhood in Metric Spaces
    
    In metric spaces, which are a specific kind of topological space defined by a distance function (metric), neighborhoods are often defined more concretely. A neighborhood of a point \(x\) can be defined as the set of all points within a certain distance (radius) of \(x\), known as an open ball. In this context, such a neighborhood is indeed an open set.
    
    ### Summary
    
    The relationship between neighborhoods and open sets is foundational in topology and varies in specificity depending on the type of space you're dealing with. While every neighborhood contains an open set around the point of interest, the neighborhood itself does not have to be open in the most general sense. However, in the specific context of metric spaces, neighborhoods defined as open balls are open sets.
    
- I mean the axiomatic definitions for a topology. They seem so arbitrary. Why define them that way
    
    The axioms of a topology might seem arbitrary at first glance, but they are designed to capture the essence of "closeness" and continuity in a very generalized and flexible way. These axioms formalize intuitive notions about space and enable the study of spaces and functions abstractly, without the need for a specific notion of distance. Let's delve into why the axioms are defined the way they are:
    
    ### 1. The empty set and the whole space are open.
    
    - **Empty set**: The inclusion of the empty set as an open set is a natural consequence of how we define open sets and neighborhoods. Since there are no points in the empty set, there are no points for which the condition of being surrounded by other points of the set can be violated. It's a base case that simplifies many proofs and definitions.
    - **Whole space**: If the entire space were not considered open, we would have no way to construct neighborhoods around points on the boundary of the space. Considering the whole space as open is essential for the internal consistency of the topology and ensures that the concept of open sets fully covers the space in question.
    
    ### 2. Any union of open sets is open.
    
    This axiom ensures that the space is sufficiently "connected" and flexible. It allows for the creation of larger open sets from smaller ones, facilitating the construction of neighborhoods around points. This property is crucial for studying continuous functions, as it guarantees that the preimage of an open set under a continuous function is also open, a key aspect of continuity in topology.
    
    ### 3. The intersection of any finite number of open sets is open.
    
    The restriction to finite intersections is a balance between maintaining some sense of "closeness" and ensuring the space's utility. While infinite intersections of open sets can be very small or even empty, potentially violating the intuitive notion of a neighborhood, finite intersections still allow for the flexibility to "narrow down" spaces without losing the openness property arbitrarily. This axiom is pivotal for defining continuity and for the study of convergent sequences (or nets) in topological spaces.
    
    ### Summary
    
    The axioms of topology are crafted to balance abstraction with intuitive notions of space and continuity. They provide a framework that is both rigorous and versatile, applicable to a vast array of mathematical and real-world contexts. By defining open sets and their properties in this way, mathematicians can explore properties of spaces that are preserved under continuous deformation, study continuity in a very generalized form, and apply these concepts across different branches of mathematics, from real analysis to differential geometry and beyond.
    

- Is homotopy bijective like homeomorphism
    
    Homotopy and homeomorphism are concepts from topology, a branch of mathematics dealing with properties of space that are preserved under continuous transformations. They both relate to the idea of transforming one shape or space into another, but they are fundamentally different concepts with different requirements and implications. Let's clarify each term:
    
    ### Homeomorphism
    
    - A **homeomorphism** is a bijective (one-to-one and onto) continuous function with a continuous inverse between two topological spaces. It essentially means that two spaces are homeomorphic if one can be deformed into the other without tearing or gluing.
    - Homeomorphisms are a strong form of equivalence between spaces, preserving topological properties like connectedness, compactness, and genus (a measure of "holes" in a surface). If two spaces are homeomorphic, they are considered the same from a topological point of view.
    
    ### Homotopy
    
    - **Homotopy** is a relation between two continuous functions from one topological space to another. Two functions are homotopic if one can be continuously deformed into the other, keeping the domain and codomain fixed.
    - Homotopy is a more flexible concept than homeomorphism. It does not require a bijective correspondence between spaces or functions, only a continuous transformation path from one function to another within the same domain and codomain.
    - While homeomorphism deals with the equivalence of spaces, homotopy deals with the equivalence of functions or mappings between spaces.
    
    In summary, while homeomorphism requires a bijective correspondence and preserves more geometric and topological properties between spaces, homotopy is about the deformability of functions and does not impose bijectivity. They address different kinds of questions in topology: homeomorphism about the equivalence of spaces themselves, and homotopy about the equivalence of mappings or paths within or between spaces.
    
- If two homeomorphic topologies have the same groups, why is it said their groups also are homotopic? Isn't that trivial since they're the same
    
    Your question seems to blend concepts from topology and algebra in an interesting way. Let's clarify these concepts to address your query effectively.
    
    1. **Homeomorphic Topologies**: Two topological spaces are homeomorphic if there exists a continuous bijection between them, with a continuous inverse. Homeomorphism is a strong form of equivalence, suggesting that the two spaces are topologically the same, meaning they share the same topological properties (e.g., number of holes, connectedness).
    2. **Groups Associated with Topological Spaces**: When referring to the "groups" of topological spaces, one often talks about algebraic invariants such as the fundamental group (π₁), higher homotopy groups (πₙ for n > 1), or homology and cohomology groups. These groups encode algebraic information about the topological structure of spaces, such as loops, holes, or higher-dimensional analogs.
    3. **Homotopy and Homotopic Maps**: Homotopy is a concept that describes a continuous deformation between two functions or maps. Two topological spaces are said to be homotopy equivalent (or have the same homotopy type) if there exist continuous maps between them that can be "deformed" into each other. A homotopy equivalence between spaces implies that their fundamental groups (and higher homotopy groups) are isomorphic, but the converse is not always true.
    
    Now, addressing your question:
    
    - If two topological spaces are homeomorphic, it indeed implies that they have isomorphic algebraic invariants, including their fundamental groups, homology groups, etc. This is because homeomorphism is a stronger condition that preserves much of the topological structure between spaces.
    - Saying that the "groups are homotopic" might be a mix-up of terminology. One could say the spaces are homotopy equivalent if there exist maps that relate their topological structures in a less rigid way than homeomorphism, and this equivalence does imply that their corresponding algebraic invariants (like the fundamental group) are isomorphic.
    
    If the statement is that "if two homeomorphic topologies have the same groups, their groups are also homotopic," it seems there's a confusion of terms:
    
    - **Correct Interpretation**: If two spaces are homeomorphic, they are indeed homotopy equivalent (a broader equivalence), and their corresponding algebraic invariants (like groups) are isomorphic.
    - **Terminological Clarification**: Saying the groups are "homotopic" isn't standard. We typically say the groups are isomorphic. The term "homotopic" applies more to maps or spaces rather than the groups themselves.
    
    In summary, the crux is that homeomorphism implies a strong form of equivalence, including isomorphism of their algebraic invariants. Homotopy equivalence is a broader concept that also implies isomorphic invariants but is a weaker condition than homeomorphism. There seems to be a slight terminological mix-up in the original statement.
    
- Do homeomorphic spaces have the same groups
    
    Yes, if two spaces are homeomorphic, then they indeed have "the same groups" in the sense that their algebraic invariants associated with topology, such as the fundamental group (π₁), higher homotopy groups (πₙ for n > 1), and homology groups, are isomorphic. This is because homeomorphisms are bijections that are continuous with continuous inverses, preserving the topological structure of the spaces involved.
    
    To elaborate:
    
    1. **Fundamental Group (π₁)**: The fundamental group captures information about loops in a space, specifically the equivalence classes of loops based at a point under continuous deformation (homotopy). If two spaces are homeomorphic, their fundamental groups are isomorphic. This isomorphism means there is a one-to-one correspondence between the loop structures and their equivalence classes in both spaces, respecting the group operations (i.e., loop concatenation).
    2. **Higher Homotopy Groups (πₙ for n > 1)**: These groups generalize the concept of the fundamental group to n-dimensional "loops" (spheres in the space). A homeomorphism ensures these groups are also isomorphic between the two spaces, preserving information about holes and voids of higher dimensions.
    3. **Homology and Cohomology Groups**: These groups are another way of studying the topological properties of spaces, focusing on features like connectivity, holes, and voids, but from an algebraic perspective that counts these features rather than describing their deformations. Homology groups are invariant under homeomorphisms, meaning that if two spaces are homeomorphic, their homology (and cohomology) groups are isomorphic.
    
    The isomorphisms of these groups are not merely coincidental; they reflect the deep interplay between algebra and topology. Homeomorphic spaces are considered the same from a topological standpoint, implying they cannot be distinguished by topological means, including their associated algebraic invariants. These invariants, or "groups," effectively capture the essence of the spaces' topological properties and are foundational to the study of topology.

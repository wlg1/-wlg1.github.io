Mapper

- filter function (lens)
    
    maps point cloud X to data or metric R
    
    eg) f(X) is an image
    
    diff filters have diff insights, such as L2 norm or y-coordinate or feature dim
    
- (open) cover
    
    Construct open cover U $\subset$ X from finite cover V $\subset$ f(X) by considering overlapping clusters of $f^{-1}(V)$
    
- nerve
- mapper graph

Forgetful functor: Grp → Set

This forgets group properties. All groups are sets but not vice versa. Forgetful is possible because grp $\sub$ set (?)

Free group functor: Set → Grp

Categories of Categories (Cat) has too strict isomorphism so can’t really compare to much except itself (?)

So use weakened isomorphism called ‘equivalence’. Can generalize further to ‘adjunction’

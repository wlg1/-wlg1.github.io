# Calculus of Variations

- What do calculus of variations and dynamic programming have to do wtih each other?
    
    Calculus of variations and dynamic programming are two closely related fields of mathematics that are concerned with finding optimal solutions to problems.
    
    Calculus of variations is the study of how to find the extremum (maximum or minimum) of a functional, which is a function that takes other functions as inputs. In other words, calculus of variations seeks to optimize a functional subject to some constraints.
    
    Dynamic programming, on the other hand, is a technique for solving optimization problems by breaking them down into smaller sub-problems and solving those sub-problems recursively. Dynamic programming is particularly useful for problems that exhibit the principle of optimality, which states that the optimal solution to a problem can be found by breaking it down into smaller sub-problems and solving each of those sub-problems optimally.
    
    The connection between calculus of variations and dynamic programming arises from the fact that many optimization problems that can be solved using dynamic programming can also be formulated as problems in calculus of variations. In fact, dynamic programming can be seen as a discrete-time version of calculus of variations, where the functional to be optimized is replaced by a sum of functions evaluated at discrete time steps.
    
    While calculus of variations deals with continuous functions and seeks to optimize a functional subject to constraints, dynamic programming deals with discrete-time problems and breaks them down into smaller sub-problems that can be solved optimally.

A simple example of such a problem is to find the curve of shortest length connecting two points. If there are no constraints, the solution is a straight line between the points. However, if the curve is constrained to lie on a surface in space, then the solution is less obvious, and possibly many solutions may exist. Such solutions are known as geodesics.

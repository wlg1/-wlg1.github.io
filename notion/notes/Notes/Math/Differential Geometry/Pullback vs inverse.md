# Pullback vs inverse

The reason an inverse transformation cannot map differential forms directly is because it acts on points rather than on objects like functions, vectors, or forms.

However, you can use an inverse transformation to define a pullback, as long as the inverse is smooth. If f: M → N is a diffeomorphism (i.e., a smooth, bijective map with a smooth inverse), then the pullback associated with the inverse transformation f^(-1) can be used to map differential forms from N to M.

<<<
the pullback φ* "pulls back" objects defined on N to objects defined on M. For example, if ω is a differential form on N, then the pullback φ*(ω) is a differential form on M.

Q: What is the difference between pullback and inverse transformation if they both map objects back?

The pullback maps differential forms, which are geometric objects that live on the tangent spaces of manifolds, while the inverse transformation maps vectors, which are algebraic objects that live in vector spaces. The pullback is defined using the inverse of the pushforward map, while the inverse transformation is defined using the inverse of the linear transformation.

The pullback is a concept from differential geometry that maps differential forms from one manifold to another. The pullback preserves the structure of the differential form, including its degree, and is defined using the inverse of the pushforward map.

The inverse transformation preserves the linear structure of the vector space, including its dimension and vector operations.

Q: Why can't the inverse transformation map differential forms?
The inverse transformation maps vectors from the image space back to vectors in the domain space, but it does not have a natural way to handle the geometric structure of differential forms, such as their degree and antisymmetry properties.

Differential forms are defined using the wedge product of differential 1-forms, which are themselves defined using the dual basis of a tangent space. The dual basis is a set of linear functionals that map tangent vectors to real numbers. Therefore, differential forms are defined using the geometry of the tangent space, rather than the algebraic structure of a vector space.

In contrast, the inverse transformation is defined in terms of linear transformations between vector spaces, which have a different algebraic structure than the tangent spaces of manifolds. While there are some connections between the geometry of manifolds and linear algebra, such as the use of tangent vectors as the basis for the tangent space, the two fields have different goals and techniques.

Q: In simpler terms, what does "natural way to handle the geometric structure of differential forms" mean?

It means that we need to use tools and concepts that are specifically designed to handle these geometric properties.

Q: GPT 3.5 says The inverse transformation maps vectors from the image space back to vectors in the domain space because it is working on vector spaces, but you say it does not work on vectors. Why?

In the context of linear algebra and vector spaces, an inverse transformation does indeed map vectors from the image (codomain) space back to vectors in the domain space.
In my previous response, I focused on the difference between the pullback and inverse transformation in the context of manifolds and differential forms, which might have led to the confusion.

Q: Why can't an inverse transformation map vectors between manifolds under a smooth map?

An inverse transformation can map vectors between manifolds under a smooth map, but there's an important distinction between mapping points and mapping tangent vectors. Let me clarify the difference.

Consider a smooth bijective map φ: M → N between two manifolds M and N, with a smooth inverse φ^(-1): N → M. The inverse transformation φ^(-1) acts on the points of the manifolds, mapping points in N back to points in M.

However, when talking about mapping vectors between manifolds, we usually refer to the pushforward and pullback, which act on tangent vectors and covectors (dual vectors), respectively. The pushforward φ_* maps tangent vectors in the tangent space T_p(M) at a point p in M to tangent vectors in the tangent space T_{φ(p)}(N) at the point φ(p) in N. The pullback φ^* maps covectors (also known as differential forms) from N to M.

Given an invertible smooth map φ, you can associate the pushforward with the inverse transformation φ^(-1) as follows: (φ^(-1))* : T_q(N) → T{φ^(-1)(q)}(M) for a point q in N. This pushforward maps tangent vectors in the tangent space T_q(N) at a point q in N to tangent vectors in the tangent space T_{φ^(-1)(q)}(M) at the point φ^(-1)(q) in M.

In summary, the inverse transformation can map points between manifolds under a smooth map. However, when discussing the mapping of tangent vectors and covectors between manifolds, we usually refer to the pushforward and pullback. The pushforward associated with the inverse transformation can indeed map tangent vectors between manifolds under a smooth map.

Q: Is the pullback just the inverse of the pushforward?

While the pushforward and pullback are related through the smooth map φ, they are not inverses of each other because they act on different types of objects. The pushforward acts on tangent vectors, while the pullback acts on covectors (differential forms). In some sense, they can be seen as "dual" operations, but they are not exactly inverses.

However, if the smooth map φ has an inverse φ^(-1): N → M, then you can relate the pushforward and pullback of φ with the pushforward and pullback of φ^(-1). In particular, the pushforward of φ^(-1) can be seen as a "dual" operation to the pullback of φ, and vice versa. But they are still not exactly inverses of each other.

<<<<<<<
Q: What's the difference between the smooth map and the pushforward?

the smooth map is a function between manifolds that preserves the differentiable structure, while the pushforward is a linear map associated with a smooth map that transfers tangent vectors from one manifold to another. Study the relationships between tangent spaces of the domain and codomain manifolds under the action of a smooth map.

<<<<<<<
Q: Is the pullback just the inverse of the pushforward if the smooth map has an inverse?

Even though the smooth map φ has an inverse φ^(-1), the pullback and pushforward are not exact inverses because they act on different objects. However, when φ has an inverse, you can relate the pullback and pushforward in a "dual" sense

Certain associated items that "go forward" or "go backwards":
Points are sent forward.
Functions are sent back
Vectors are send forward.

One-forms give linear functionals on each tangent space; that is, they're functions which take vectors as input. As such, just like functions, they're sent back.

Basically, geometric objects "go forward" and functions on them "go back."

The mapping α already lets you assign to each point x∈A an associated point y=α(x)∈B, but you'd like to use it to form associations between functions and more.

The pullback/pushforward catch is that the association does not always run in the same direction.

However, the pull back map for vectors would require the inverse function F^−1 which may not necessarily exist and this is why we cannot define a pull back for vector fields.

The fundamental intuition is that it doesn't matter which manifold you do your calculations in, you get the same result either way.

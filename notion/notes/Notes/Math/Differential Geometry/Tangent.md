# Tangent

Mapping tangent vectors is important in the study of manifolds and differential geometry for several reasons:

1. Tangent vectors describe local properties: Tangent vectors at a point on a manifold capture the local behavior of curves passing through that point. By mapping tangent vectors, we can study the local properties of a manifold and understand how these properties transform under smooth maps between manifolds.
2. Coordinate changes: In differential geometry, we often need to change coordinates to work with different charts on the same manifold. Mapping tangent vectors allows us to understand how vector fields and other geometric objects transform under coordinate changes.
3. Differential equations: Mapping tangent vectors plays a crucial role in the study of differential equations on manifolds. By understanding how tangent vectors transform under smooth maps, we can analyze how solutions to differential equations on one manifold relate to solutions on another manifold. This is particularly important when studying the flow of a vector field, which is the integral curve of a tangent vector at a point.
4. Differential forms and integration: Mapping tangent vectors is essential for understanding how differential forms (which are covectors) transform under smooth maps. This is important for the integration of differential forms, which is used to define geometric quantities like surface area, volume, and flux.
5. Vector fields and flows: Vector fields on manifolds are sections of the tangent bundle, assigning a tangent vector to each point on the manifold. Mapping tangent vectors allows us to study how vector fields and their associated flows transform under smooth maps.

Lie derivatives and Lie groups: In the context of Lie groups and Lie algebras, mapping tangent vectors is essential for understanding the Lie bracket, which measures the "commutator" of two vector fields. The Lie bracket plays a central role in the study of symmetry transformations and the dynamics of physical systems.

Q: For a curved manifold X, why can all the geometrical properties of X be derived from its metric in its set of tangent space patches?

In mathematics, a manifold is a topological space that locally resembles Euclidean space near each point. A curved manifold X can be described using a set of tangent space patches, which are small regions that can be approximated by Euclidean space.

In the tangent space patches, the metric can be expressed using a coordinate system, which allows us to calculate distances and angles. By considering the metric in each tangent space patch, we can derive important geometric properties of the manifold, such as curvature, geodesics, and volume.

For example, the curvature of a manifold can be determined by examining the behavior of geodesics, which are paths that follow the shortest distance between two points on the manifold.

- In the tangent space patches, the curvature can be measured by calculating the Riemann curvature tensor, which describes the deviation of parallel transport around a closed loop.
- By considering the Riemann curvature tensor in each tangent space patch, we can determine the curvature of the entire manifold.

Similarly, the volume of the manifold can be derived from its metric in the tangent space patches. By calculating the determinant of the metric in each patch and then integrating over the manifold, we can determine the total volume.

In summary, the metric in the set of tangent space patches allows us to calculate distances and angles and to determine important geometric properties of the manifold, such as curvature and volume.

Q: How do we check if a space has local linearity?

To check if a space has local linearity, we need to examine whether the space is locally homeomorphic to Euclidean space. In other words, we need to verify that each point in the space has a neighborhood that can be mapped bijectively onto a neighborhood in Euclidean space, such that the map preserves the structure of the space.

More formally, a space is locally linear or locally Euclidean if it satisfies the following condition:

For every point p in the space, there exists a neighborhood U of p and a continuous map φ : U → V, where V is an open subset of Euclidean space, such that φ is bijective and the inverse map φ^(-1) is also continuous.

In other words, we can find a chart (i.e., a coordinate system) around every point in the space that maps the neighborhood of the point to a corresponding subset of Euclidean space, and this chart is continuous and differentiable.

If a space satisfies this condition, we say that it is a manifold.

To verify that a space has local linearity, we typically use tools from topology, such as the concept of a homeomorphism, which is a bijective map between two topological spaces that preserves their topological structure. If we can find a homeomorphism between a neighborhood of a point in the space and a neighborhood in Euclidean space, then we can conclude that the space is locally linear.

Q: Your answer will only be 3 paragraphs. Give an example of finding a chart that maps to Euclidean space
Let's consider the two-dimensional torus, which is a curved surface that can be thought of as a doughnut shape. The torus can be parametrized by two coordinates, say θ and φ, where θ varies over the interval [0, 2π] and φ varies over the interval [0, 2π] as well. One common parametrization is given by:

x = (R + r cos(φ)) cos(θ)
y = (R + r cos(φ)) sin(θ)
z = r sin(φ)

Here, R and r are constants that determine the size of the torus.

To find a chart that maps a subset of the torus to Euclidean space, we can choose a suitable subset of the θ-φ plane and restrict the parametrization to that subset. For example, we can choose a small rectangle R in the θ-φ plane and restrict the parametrization to that rectangle, giving us a chart (U, φ), where U is the image of the rectangle R under the parametrization and φ is the parametrization itself.

The resulting chart maps a subset of the torus to a subset of Euclidean space, and it preserves the structure of the torus in the sense that the metric and other geometric properties of the torus can be expressed in terms of the Euclidean distance and angles in the plane.

Q: How do the two coordinates θ and φ describe a torus?
The two coordinates θ and φ are used to parametrize the points on the surface of a torus, which is a two-dimensional shape that can be thought of as a doughnut or a ring. The torus is characterized by two radii: the distance from the center of the ring to the center of the doughnut, which is denoted by R, and the radius of the cross-section of the ring, which is denoted by r.

The first coordinate, θ, determines the angle of rotation around the center axis of the torus. Specifically, as θ varies from 0 to 2π, the point on the torus moves around the center axis, completing a full rotation after 2π.

The second coordinate, φ, determines the angle of rotation around the cross-sectional circle of the torus. Specifically, as φ varies from 0 to 2π, the point on the torus moves around the cross-sectional circle, completing a full rotation after 2π.

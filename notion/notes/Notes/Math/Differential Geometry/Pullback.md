Q: Why does the pullback use the Jacobian?

chatgpt: The pullback of a smooth map between two manifolds is a way to transfer geometric objects from one manifold to another. Given a smooth map between manifolds, the pullback maps tangent vectors in the target manifold to tangent vectors in the domain manifold.

The Jacobian matrix of a smooth map gives information about how tangent vectors in the domain manifold are mapped to tangent vectors in the target manifold. Specifically, the Jacobian matrix describes the linear approximation of the map near a point in the domain manifold.

Jacobian: domain -> target
thus, inverse is: target -> domain

pullback maps target -> domain

Therefore, the Jacobian matrix is useful in computing the pullback of geometric objects such as differential forms, which are defined on the tangent spaces of the target manifold.

The pullback uses the Jacobian matrix because it provides a linear approximation of the map that relates tangent vectors in the domain and target manifolds.

Q: Without using the Jacobian, is it hard to calculate the map that relates tangent vectors in the domain and target manifolds?

A chatgpt [paraphrased]: Yes, because the tangent spaces of manifolds are abstract spaces that do not have a natural coordinate system or metric.

(etc):
The Jacobian matrix provides a way to represent the linear approximation of a smooth map between manifolds in terms of a matrix of partial derivatives. This matrix is well-defined regardless of the choice of coordinates on the manifolds and provides a natural way to relate tangent vectors in the domain and target manifolds.

However, if we do not use the Jacobian matrix, we would need to find another way to describe the map between the tangent spaces of the two manifolds. One approach is to use the concept of a pushforward map, which is the dual concept to the pullback map. The pushforward map maps tangent vectors in the domain manifold to tangent vectors in the target manifold.

In some cases, the pushforward map may be easier to compute than the pullback map. However, the pushforward map can be harder to interpret geometrically than the pullback map, which is why the pullback map and its use of the Jacobian matrix are commonly used in differential geometry and related fields.

Q: What are the step to calculate the pullback?

chatgpt: Here are the general steps to calculate the pullback of a differential form using the pullback map:

1. Given a smooth map between manifolds, identify the differential form on the target manifold that you want to pull back to the domain manifold.
2. Choose local coordinates on the domain and target manifolds, and use them to write the differential form on the target manifold as a function of the coordinates.
3. Use the chain rule to express the differential form on the target manifold in terms of the coordinates on the domain manifold. This will involve applying the pullback map to the tangent vectors in the expression.
4. Substitute the coordinates on the domain manifold back into the expression obtained in step 3. This gives the differential form pulled back to the domain manifold.
5. Verify that the pulled-back differential form is well-defined, i.e., independent of the choice of local coordinates on the domain and target manifolds.

Note that the actual calculations involved in these steps can be quite involved, especially for higher-order differential forms or more complicated pullback maps. Additionally, there may be special techniques or shortcuts available for certain types of differential forms or pullback maps. However, the general steps outlined above provide a framework for calculating the pullback of a differential form.

3. Use the chain rule and the Jacobian matrix of the smooth map to express the differential form on the target manifold in terms of the coordinates on the domain manifold.

In step 3, the Jacobian matrix of the smooth map is used to represent the linear approximation of the map near a point in the domain manifold. Specifically, the Jacobian matrix describes how tangent vectors in the domain manifold are mapped to tangent vectors in the target manifold.

To use the Jacobian matrix to calculate the pullback, we apply it to the basis vectors of the tangent space of the domain manifold. These basis vectors represent the tangent vectors on the domain manifold that we want to map to the tangent vectors on the target manifold.

By applying the Jacobian matrix to the basis vectors, we obtain a set of tangent vectors on the target manifold, which can be used to express the differential form on the target manifold in terms of the coordinates on the domain manifold.

- NeurIPS Latex format
    
    To prepare your paper in LaTeX format for NeurIPS (Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems) and submit it on Overleaf, you can follow these steps:
    
    1. Start with the NeurIPS LaTeX template: NeurIPS provides an official LaTeX template that you can use as a starting point for your paper. You can download the template from the NeurIPS CALL FOR PAPERS ([https://nips.cc/Conferences/2023/CallForPapers](https://nips.cc/Conferences/2023/CallForPapers)). Both .tex and .sty: Right click, save as
    2. ([https://www.overleaf.com](https://www.overleaf.com/)) and create a new project.
    3. Upload the NeurIPS template to Overleaf: In your new Overleaf project, upload the NeurIPS LaTeX template you downloaded in Step 1. You can do this by clicking on the "New Project" button and selecting the "Upload Project" option.
        1. Upload the .tex and .sty files: To upload the .tex and .sty files, simply drag and drop them from your computer's file explorer or folder onto the project file list in Overleaf. Alternatively, you can click on the "Upload" button in the project file list and select the files from your computer. `neurips_2023.tex` can replace main.tex
    4. Format your paper according to NeurIPS guidelines: Refer to the NeurIPS guidelines and formatting instructions provided on their website. Ensure that your paper adheres to the required formatting, including font size, margins, section headings, references, and any specific guidelines provided by NeurIPS.
    5. Submit your paper: Once you are satisfied with your paper and it conforms to the NeurIPS guidelines, download the final PDF from Overleaf and follow the submission instructions provided by NeurIPS. Usually, you will need to submit your paper through the NeurIPS conference submission system.

- Why "Advances in" in front of some conferences?
    
    The use of "Advances in" as a prefix for certain conference names, such as "Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems" (NeurIPS) or "Advances in Machine Learning" (AISTATS), serves as a way to indicate that the conference focuses on cutting-edge developments and advancements in a specific field.
    
    The term "Advances in" suggests that the conference aims to showcase the latest progress, innovations, and breakthroughs within a particular domain. It emphasizes the forward-looking nature of the conference and signals that the event is at the forefront of research and development in the field.
    
    By using "Advances in" as part of the conference name, the organizers aim to attract researchers, academics, and industry professionals who are actively engaged in pushing the boundaries of knowledge and technology in that specific area. It conveys a sense of dynamism, excitement, and anticipation for new discoveries and advancements.
    
    The use of such a prefix can help differentiate the conference from others in the same field and highlight its focus on highlighting the most recent and significant contributions. It also sets the tone and expectations for participants, indicating that the conference will feature cutting-edge research, state-of-the-art methodologies, and emerging trends.
    
    Overall, the inclusion of "Advances in" in the conference name is a way to convey the forward-looking nature and emphasis on the latest advancements within a specific field or discipline.

*Generalize Coding Styles and copy them into Technq Comp and Quizzes*

- Prog quizzes
    
    Make quizzes of filling in programming based on docstring instructions. Just take existing code and remove parts of them. Similar to ARENA exercises. Must review as will forget over time how to solve them. Timing self of how to solve the same problem maintains/improves research speed of programming new ideas, which improves productivity of result output.
    
    The aim is to practice certain recalling of concepts that can be generalized. This is why doing the same exercise helps- as it solidifies recalling how to use this concept. This is a “repetitive” exercise that is more like a drill, whereas solving new problems is like a practice game. A reason for a human to know this instead of just using code LLMs is that knowing generalizations can sometimes help your own mind, which is different and sometimes better than code LLMs, beat code LLMs (when they fail). Recognizing coding patterns allows for faster understanding and re-using similar solutions from before
    
    Keep stats, where solving more drills faster increases stats faster. Mostly personal, but can also do on stream (say will be slower because must explain to audience to make sure they follow; so on stream, may not time self at all and say ‘not aiming for speed’, but mention that viewers can do it if they want). From stream, start at 0- this doesn’t mean “know nothing”, it means “0 relative to ability of current state on [the recorded start day]. Don’t always need to add to stats; can do outside of stat recording. Say: used to demonstrate to viewers on one way of how to study (imply not as a way to show-off skills).
    
    Also record a video (both cut summary + uncut real-time) of studying. Have both recorded videos (no audience) and live stream. Put samples of rec vids before try doing stream to gauge what teaching aspects the viewers find helpful in the lesson.
    
    Red H means unanswered question someone has, blue H means answered.
    
    Create copy instances of notes so people can edit them in their own way without interferring with others’ versions.
    
    To link to the code version, create a fork or local clone so that you can link to your own older copy without newer updates messing with it. use a separte github profile (google profiles) that is all about learning instead of making, so the main profile isn’t overwhelmed with learning code

**limit set: the** state a dynamical system reaches after an infinite amount of time. Types:

- [fixed points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_point_(mathematics))
- [periodic orbits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodic_orbit)
- [limit cycles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limit_cycle)
- [attractors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attractor)

- E**quilibrium and Steady State**
    
    A system that has reached its limiting set is said to be at **equilibrium**. [Questionable if equilibrium means ‘no var change’?]
    
    - Does equilibrium mean no change in dynamical systems?
        
        No, equilibrium in dynamical systems does not necessarily mean no change. In the context of dynamical systems, equilibrium refers to a state where the system's variables do not change over time, but it does not imply that there is no movement or activity within the system.
        
        In a dynamical system, equilibrium is often associated with a stable state where the system's behavior tends to return to a particular configuration or set of values. When a system is in equilibrium, it means that the forces or influences acting on the system are balanced, resulting in a steady state. However, this does not mean that there is no motion or activity within the system. There can still be internal dynamics or fluctuations happening around the equilibrium point.
        
        Furthermore, dynamical systems can exhibit different types of equilibria. Apart from stable equilibria, there are also unstable and semi-stable equilibria. Unstable equilibria are points where small perturbations can cause the system to move away from the equilibrium state, while semi-stable equilibria can have both stable and unstable directions of movement.
        
        So, while equilibrium implies a lack of change in the system's variables, it does not imply an absence of dynamics or activity within the system itself.
        
    - How does equilibrium differ from steady state?
        
        Equilibrium: In a dynamical system, equilibrium refers to a state where the system's variables remain constant over time. It represents a balance or stability point where the forces or influences acting on the system are in equilibrium. Mathematically, equilibrium occurs when the rates of change of the system's variables are zero. In an equilibrium state, the system may not be undergoing any changes, but it doesn't necessarily mean that there is no motion or activity within the system.
        
        Steady state: A steady state, on the other hand, refers to a condition where the system's variables do not change over time, but there can still be ongoing activity or dynamics within the system. In a steady state, the system has reached a stable configuration, and the variables remain constant, but this doesn't mean that the system is not experiencing internal processes or fluctuations. These internal processes can be ongoing, and they may balance out or cancel each other out, resulting in a constant value for the system's variables.
        
        In essence, equilibrium emphasizes the absence of change in the system's variables, while steady state emphasizes the constancy of the variables over time. Steady state can occur even when there are internal processes or fluctuations happening within the system, as long as the overall result is a balance that maintains the variables at a constant level.
        
    - When a system reaches its limiting set, are the rates of change of its variables zero?
        
        When a system reaches its limiting set, it does not necessarily mean that the rates of change of its variables are zero. The limiting set of a system refers to the set of states or values that the system approaches or tends to as time goes to infinity.
        
        In some cases, the rates of change of the system's variables may indeed approach zero as the system approaches its limiting set. This is often the case in stable equilibria, where the system's variables reach a constant value and remain unchanged over time. At a stable equilibrium, the rates of change of the variables are zero because the system is in a balanced state.
        
        However, reaching a limiting set does not always imply that the rates of change are zero. In systems with limit cycles or oscillatory behavior, the variables may continue to change, but they do so in a repetitive or periodic manner. In these cases, the rates of change may not be zero, but they are balanced by the system's internal dynamics, resulting in a cyclic behavior around the limiting set.
        
        Therefore, while the rates of change of a system's variables can be zero in some cases when it reaches its limiting set, it is not a general rule. The behavior of the rates of change depends on the specific dynamics and properties of the system.

set of states toward which a system tends to evolve

Attractors are limit sets, but not all limit sets are attractors: It is possible to have some points of a system converge to a limit set, but different points when perturbed slightly off the limit set may get knocked off and never return to the vicinity of the limit set.

Two simple attractors are a [fixed point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_point_(mathematics)) and the [limit cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limit_cycle).

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limit_cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limit_cycle)

a **limit cycle** is a closed [trajectory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trajectory) in phase space having the property that at least one other trajectory spirals into it either as time approaches infinity or as time approaches negative infinity.

- How do limit cycles differ from oscillations?
    
    Oscillation is a more general term that refers to any repetitive or periodic motion or behavior. It encompasses a wide range of phenomena that exhibit regular back-and-forth movement or variation. Examples of oscillations include the swinging of a pendulum, the vibrations of a guitar string, or the oscillations of an alternating current.
    
    A limit cycle, on the other hand, is a specific type of oscillation that occurs in dynamical systems. It refers to a stable and repetitive trajectory or pattern that a system follows over time, returning to a particular state or set of states after a fixed period. In other words, a limit cycle represents a stable periodic behavior in a dynamic system.
    
    The key distinction between a general oscillation and a limit cycle is the notion of stability. Oscillations, in general, can be stable or unstable, while a limit cycle is always stable. Stability means that the system will remain close to the limit cycle and return to it even if subjected to small perturbations or disturbances. In a limit cycle, the amplitude, frequency, and shape of the oscillation are typically well-defined and consistent.
    
    In summary, oscillations refer to any repetitive or periodic motion, while a limit cycle specifically describes a stable and periodic behavior in a dynamical system. All limit cycles are oscillations, but not all oscillations are limit cycles. Some oscillations may be unstable or transient, while limit cycles represent a stable and sustained periodic behavior.

Relaxation oscillations are a type of [limit cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limit_cycle)

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit_(dynamics)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit_(dynamics))

- How does orbit differ from oscillation and limit cycle?
    
    Orbit: An orbit refers to the trajectory or path traced out by a system's variables over time. It represents the movement of the system through its state space. In the context of dynamical systems, an orbit can be periodic or non-periodic. A periodic orbit repeats itself after a certain period of time, while a non-periodic orbit does not exhibit any repetitive pattern.
    
    Unlike an orbit, which can be periodic or non-periodic, a limit cycle specifically represents a stable and recurring pattern of behavior. The variables in a limit cycle will follow the same trajectory indefinitely without diverging or converging to a fixed point or equilibrium. Limit cycles often arise in systems with feedback or self-sustaining mechanisms.
    
    In summary, an orbit is the path traced out by a system's variables, oscillation refers to repetitive back-and-forth motion, and a limit cycle represents a stable and recurring closed trajectory in the system's state space. Oscillation is a more general term that can occur in different types of systems, while a limit cycle is a specific type of periodic behavior that implies stability and repetition.
    
- How does orbit differ from trajectory?
    
    In the context of dynamical systems, the terms "orbit" and "trajectory" are often used interchangeably to refer to the path traced out by the system's variables over time. However, there can be a subtle distinction between the two terms in certain contexts:
    
    Orbit: An orbit typically refers to the path traced out by a system's variables in the system's state space, which is a mathematical representation of all possible states of the system. The orbit emphasizes the behavior of the system in its state space and can be described by a sequence of points or states that the system visits as time progresses. Orbits can be periodic, non-periodic, or even chaotic, depending on the nature of the system and its dynamics.
    
    Trajectory: Trajectory, on the other hand, can have a broader interpretation and can refer to the actual physical path or motion of a system in physical space. It emphasizes the movement or evolution of the system through physical space rather than the abstract state space. Trajectory often implies the spatial aspects of the system's motion, such as the position and velocity of the system at different points in time.
    
    In summary, while the terms "orbit" and "trajectory" are often used interchangeably to describe the path of a dynamical system, "orbit" tends to focus on the system's behavior in its abstract state space, whereas "trajectory" can encompass the actual physical motion of the system in physical space.

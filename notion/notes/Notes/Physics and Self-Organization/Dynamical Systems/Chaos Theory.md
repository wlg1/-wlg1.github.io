- Relation to limit cycles
    
    Limit cycles are a characteristic of periodic or oscillatory behavior in dynamic systems. A limit cycle refers to a repetitive pattern or trajectory that a system follows over time, returning to a particular state or set of states after a fixed period.
    
    While chaotic systems can exhibit complex and irregular behavior, often without stable limit cycles, non-chaotic systems can also have limit cycles. Limit cycles can be observed in various types of systems, including mechanical systems, biological systems, electronic circuits, and more.
    
    For example, in biology, the heartbeat of an organism can be represented as a limit cycle where the heart muscle contracts and relaxes rhythmically. Similarly, the oscillations of a pendulum or the alternating current in an electrical circuit can be described by limit cycles.
    
    Chaotic systems, on the other hand, do not exhibit **stable** limit cycles. They typically display aperiodic behavior, with trajectories that may seem random and unpredictable. Chaotic systems are characterized by sensitive dependence on initial conditions and can show irregular, yet deterministic, behavior. However, it's important to note that not all non-chaotic systems necessarily have limit cycles, as they can also exhibit other types of dynamic behavior such as fixed points, bifurcations, or even more complex patterns.

- How come most systems aren't chaotic?
    
    While chaotic behavior can arise in certain systems, it is relatively rare in comparison to the vast range of systems observed in nature.
    
    Instead, biological systems often display dynamic and adaptive behaviors, regulated by feedback mechanisms and homeostatic control systems. These systems help maintain stability and respond to internal and external changes, allowing organisms to survive and function in their environments.

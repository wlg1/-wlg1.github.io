- Explain why shannon entropy is used
    
    ![Untitled](TopoBert%20d4c0366b289343de953e4531cb1d6ffe/Untitled%201.png)
    
    Shannon entropy is used in this context to measure the uncertainty or the unpredictability of a distribution. In the excerpt from the paper, it talks about the concept of "purity" in a topological neighborhood for data points. Shannon entropy is a fundamental concept from information theory that quantifies the average amount of information produced by a stochastic source of data.
    
    Here's why Shannon entropy is relevant for measuring purity:
    
    1. **Uncertainty Measurement**: Entropy provides a measure of how much uncertainty there is in the distribution of labels. In a pure neighborhood, where all points belong to the same class, there is no uncertainty, and therefore the entropy is zero.
    2. **Uniformity**: When the distribution of labels is uniform (i.e., each class is equally likely), the entropy is maximized. This corresponds to the idea of a completely impure neighborhood, where there is maximum uncertainty about the classification of any given point.
    3. **Comparative Index**: By comparing the entropy of the observed distribution \(H(D_X)\) with the entropy of a uniform distribution \(H(D)\), we can quantify the relative purity. If the observed distribution has lower entropy compared to the uniform distribution, it indicates a higher level of purity.
    4. **Normalization**: The expression \(1 - \frac{H(D_X)}{H(D)}\) normalizes the purity measure so that it ranges between 0 and 1. A value of 1 indicates pure neighborhoods (zero entropy or no uncertainty), and a value of 0 indicates maximum entropy relative to a uniform distribution (highest uncertainty).
    5. **Versatility**: Shannon entropy can be applied to distributions with any number of classes and does not rely on any particular property of the data other than the distribution of labels.
    
    Using Shannon entropy for measuring purity in this way allows for a standardized approach to quantify how well-separated the classes are within neighborhoods of data points, which is particularly useful in fields like cluster analysis, pattern recognition, and machine learning.
    
- Explain what prediction accuracy of a topological neighborhood is in this paper
    
    In the paper, the prediction accuracy of a topological neighborhood is related to the robustness of the model against adversarial attacks. Topological neighborhoods with high prediction accuracy are those where the model's predicted labels match the true labels of the data points. Conversely, weak topological regions, or neighborhoods with low prediction accuracy, are identified as those that might be more vulnerable to adversarial attacks. The paper uses node-wise prediction accuracy to evaluate and visualize the robustness of models under adversarial conditions. High accuracy indicates robustness, while lower accuracy suggests vulnerability.
    
    The authors detail an experimental setup where they refine adversarially-trained models by leveraging weak regions—those with low prediction accuracy—in the mapper graph. They observe that for an MLP with MNIST data, there is a marginal improvement in robust accuracy when the model is further refined using samples from these weak regions. However, the same was not observed with the ResNet-18 model trained on CIFAR-10 data, indicating the importance of purity in topological neighborhoods for model refinement. Purity is closely related to prediction accuracy, as it involves the distribution of class labels within a neighborhood. High-purity neighborhoods tend to have high prediction accuracy, as all points belong to the same class, while low-purity (or impure) neighborhoods, which have a mixture of classes, tend to have lower prediction accuracy  .
    
- What do you mean "Topological neighborhoods with high prediction accuracy are those where the model's predicted labels match the true labels of the data points."? How can these neighborhoods have predicted labels when a model has predicted labels (the class prediction given an input)?
    
    You're right to clarify. When I mentioned "topological neighborhoods with high prediction accuracy," it refers to the concept within the model's activation space where clusters of data points (which represent the neighborhoods) are formed based on the model's neuron activations. These clusters are then analyzed for how consistently the model predicts their class labels correctly.
    
    So, in clearer terms:
    
    - Each "neighborhood" is a cluster of activations within the neural network's high-dimensional activation space. These clusters are formed by grouping together data points (activations) that are similar to each other.
    - **The "predicted labels" refer to the model's output for each data point within a neighborhood,** which is the model's prediction of the class label based on the input data.
    - The "true labels" are the actual class labels of the data points, which are known beforehand from the dataset.
    - "Prediction accuracy" of a neighborhood, then, measures the proportion of data points within that neighborhood for which the model's predicted labels match their true labels. A high prediction accuracy in a neighborhood means that the model is generally making the correct predictions for the data points within that cluster, indicating that the model's internal representations (as captured by the neuron activations) are meaningful and reliable for those particular data points.
- Each input is an activation vector. A T neigh has multiple activation vectors, and thus multiple inputs. Each input also has a predicted output. Thus, each point in a T neigh is a triple of (input, actv vector in layer, class output).
    - This is the “true labeling” of activations that is used to calculate T_neigh purity
    - The prediction acc of a model is how many labels for all inputs the model gets correct. My guess is that prediction accuracy of a T neigh is how many labels of the inputs in that neigh the model gets correct. This is not explicitly stated but seems to be the most likely.
        - this is supported by the last line of p5, “As show in Figure 3, node 156…”

- Why did this paper use mapper? In its experiments what could mapper do that clustering can't? Aren't neighborhood purity just clusters?
    1. **Multiscale Clustering**: Unlike standard clustering algorithms that provide a single partitioning of the data, mapper can reflect multiple scales, revealing data structures at different levels of granularity.
        1. **Flexible Filtering**: Mapper uses filter functions that project high-dimensional data into lower dimensions, where the clustering is then applied. This allows for the exploration of data structures that align with specific features or functions.
    2. **Overlap**: The nodes (clusters) in a mapper graph often overlap, which can reveal the connection between clusters that might be treated as separate by traditional clustering.
        1. **Topology Preservation**: Mapper can capture the shape of the data, preserving the underlying topological features such as loops and voids that standard clustering methods might not detect.
    3. **Interactivity and Interpretability**: The mapper graph allows for interactive exploration of data and helps in understanding the complex relationships between features, which is particularly valuable for interpreting deep learning models.
    
    In the context of this paper, mapper is used to analyze neuron activations from adversarial training. The mapper graph helps identify regions in the activation space with varying degrees of robustness against adversarial attacks. Neighborhood purity, as clusters of activations with consistent predicted labels, can indeed be identified through clustering. 
    
    However, mapper adds a layer of topological analysis, showing how these "pure" neighborhoods connect and interact with "impure" ones, providing insights into the global structure of the model's internal representations. 
    
- Explain with detailed evidence: However, mapper adds a layer of topological analysis, showing how these "pure" neighborhoods connect and interact with "impure" ones, providing insights into the global structure of the model's internal representations.
    
    The mapper algorithm adds a layer of topological analysis to the study of data by considering not only the local structure of the data (as in clusters) but also the global structure of how these clusters interact. Here's how:
    
    1. **Construction of Overlapping Clusters**: Mapper creates clusters that can have shared data points (overlap), unlike many clustering algorithms which partition the data into separate, non-overlapping clusters. This allows for the exploration of continuity and connectivity between clusters.
    2. **Filter Functions**: Mapper applies filter functions to the data, which are essentially dimensions or measures that highlight particular aspects of the data. This could be any function of interest, such as density, distance from a centroid, a measure of centrality, or even a machine learning model’s outputs. These functions guide the clustering process and allow for the analysis of data from different perspectives.
    3. **Graph Representation**: The result of the mapper algorithm is a graph, where each node represents a cluster, and edges connect nodes if their corresponding clusters have a nonempty intersection. This graph structure allows us to see how clusters (or "neighborhoods") are linked, forming a bigger picture of the data’s shape and structure.
    4. **Revealing Data Shape and Structure**: By visualizing the mapper graph, one can identify not only clusters but also loops, flares, and other complex structures that would be missed by standard clustering. This reveals the shape (topology) of the data in the high-dimensional space.
    
    In terms of "pure" and "impure" neighborhoods:
    
    - **"Pure" neighborhoods** are those where data points predominantly belong to a single class.
    - **"Impure" neighborhoods** contain a mixture of classes.
    
    Evidence from the paper suggests that:
    
    - **Connection Between Pure and Impure Neighborhoods**: Mapper graphs show connections between pure and impure neighborhoods. An edge between a pure and an impure node indicates a transition area where the model's certainty (purity) begins to degrade, potentially revealing regions of the data space where the model's predictions start to become unreliable.
    - **Insight into Model Behavior**: By analyzing these connections, one can understand how adversarial examples bridge the gap between different classes within the model's representation space, providing insight into how and where the model is vulnerable to adversarial attacks.
    
    Mapper thus adds an analytical dimension that goes beyond what clustering on its own can achieve, by not just identifying regions of homogeneity and heterogeneity but by also examining the relationship between these regions within the context of the entire data space.
    
- Why did they use l2 norm, or activations as filter? Isn't that redundant since the distance is in latent space which uses neurons as basis?
    1. **Dimensionality Reduction**: The high-dimensional activation space of a neural network can be hard to interpret. The L2 norm collapses this space into a single dimension while preserving the notion of "distance" between points, allowing for a simplified, yet informative, view of the data structure.
    2. **Global Structure Insight**: The L2 norm of neuron activations as a filter function provides a view of the data that emphasizes global distance relationships. It helps to identify regions of high and low neuron activation magnitudes, which can correlate with how confident the network is about its predictions or how typical or atypical a data point is.
    3. **Sensitivity to Perturbations**: In the context of adversarial training, the L2 norm can be particularly revealing. Adversarial examples often involve perturbations that are small in the input space but result in large changes in the activation space. Using the L2 norm as a filter function can highlight regions where such perturbations have the most significant effect.
    4. **Inter-cluster Relationships**: While the L2 norm is a measure of distance in the latent space, using it as a filter function in mapper allows for the examination of inter-cluster relationships. By clustering according to L2 norm values, mapper can reveal how these clusters, which might be close in L2 distance, overlap or connect, thus providing a more nuanced understanding of the model's internal representation.
    5. **Focus on Robustness**: The mapper graph constructed using such a filter can indicate areas in the activation space that are sensitive to input changes (potentially adversarial examples), thus providing insights into the robustness of the network.
    
    In summary, the choice of L2 norm or activations is not redundant but rather provides a meaningful, one-dimensional representation of the activation space that captures and highlights properties relevant to the model's robustness against adversarial attacks. It simplifies the complexity of the high-dimensional space while retaining the essential characteristics needed for a topological analysis.
    
- But isn't it the same as Euclidean distance of latent space
    
    Indeed, using the L2 norm of the activations as a filter function could seem akin to simply using the Euclidean distance in the latent space for clustering, since the L2 norm is essentially the Euclidean distance from the origin to the point in that space. However, there are a few subtleties that make this choice meaningful for the mapper algorithm:
    
    1. **Reference Point**: The L2 norm measures the magnitude of activations with respect to the origin of the latent space. This can be insightful because **it doesn't depend on the relationships between data points but rather on their relationship to a common reference point,** allowing us to see which points have the most significant overall activation and could be considered as outliers or anomalies.
    2. **Uniform Measurement Across Samples**: By measuring every point's distance from the origin, you get a uniform way to evaluate all points, which can be especially informative when trying to understand the influence of adversarial perturbations, as they might cause points to "move out" from dense clusters.
    3. **Sensitivity to Activation Strength**: The filter based on the L2 norm highlights the strength of activations, which can correspond to the level of activity in response to certain inputs. It can help identify which neurons are most active or which data points cause strong activations across the network, potentially indicating areas where the network is more or less confident.
    4. **Dimensionality Reduction**: Even though the L2 norm is a measure in the latent space, it reduces the dimensionality to a single scalar value per point, which simplifies the visualization and analysis of the data, especially when trying to convey complex, multidimensional relationships in a form that is easier to interpret.
    5. **Topology Preservation**: Mapper's use of the L2 norm isn't just for clustering but also for creating a graph that shows the topological structure of the data, something that traditional clustering with Euclidean distance doesn't do.
    
    In essence, while the L2 norm does utilize the same metric space as the Euclidean distance for clustering, its use in the mapper algorithm serves a specific purpose, allowing for the exploration of the data's global structure and its variations in activation magnitude, which can be especially useful in the context of adversarial robustness analysis.
    
- Can a feature vector be used as filter
    
    Yes, a feature vector can indeed be used as a filter in the mapper algorithm. The mapper algorithm is quite flexible and can use any scalar function as a filter, including functions derived from feature vectors. This filter function essentially guides the slicing and clustering within the mapper framework.
    
    Using a feature vector as a filter typically involves some preprocessing, since the mapper requires scalar values to form the cover. There are several ways a feature vector can be used:
    
    1. **Dimensionality Reduction**: Techniques like PCA, t-SNE, or UMAP can reduce the feature vector to one or two dimensions that capture most of the variance or preserve local structures. The reduced dimensions serve as scalar filters.
    2. **Feature Aggregation**: Aggregating features into a single scalar, such as taking the sum, average, or even a weighted sum based on feature importance, can provide a meaningful filter function.
    3. **Distance Measures**: Calculating the distance of each feature vector from a reference vector (e.g., the centroid of a cluster) can provide a scalar value indicative of similarity or dissimilarity.
    4. **Domain-specific Functions**: A domain-specific function of the feature vector that yields a scalar value can be used. For instance, in bioinformatics, one might use a function that measures gene expression levels.
    
    The choice of feature vector and the method of transforming it into a scalar filter function should be guided by the specific insights one hopes to gain from the mapper graph. The filter function should highlight the variations in the data that are most relevant to the question or problem at hand.
    
- The L2 norm and the length of a feature vector essentially refer to the same concept.
- What does it mean to use filter function as length of feature vector when interpreting mapper output
    
    When you use the length of the feature vector (or its L2 norm) as the filter function in the mapper algorithm, you're mapping each high-dimensional data point to a single value that represents the magnitude of that point's features. Interpreting the mapper output using this filter function involves the following:
    
    1. **Magnitude Representation**: Each node in the mapper graph represents a set of data points that have similar magnitudes of their feature vectors. Nodes corresponding to larger L2 norms indicate areas in the feature space where data points have higher overall values, which might suggest stronger activations or higher intensities in the context of the data.
    2. **Grouping by Feature Intensity**: The algorithm will group data points into clusters where the intensity of the features is similar. This can reveal patterns or groupings in the data that are related to the scale of the features rather than the specific values of individual features.
    3. **Anomaly Detection**: Points with significantly higher L2 norms may be considered outliers or anomalies. These points stand out because their features have larger values in magnitude compared to the rest of the data.
    4. **Data Gradient**: If the feature vector length varies smoothly across the data, the mapper graph can reveal a gradient, showing transitions from areas of low feature activity to high feature activity.
    5. **Sensitivity to Perturbations**: In contexts such as image processing or adversarial learning, large feature vector lengths might correspond to points that are more sensitive to noise or perturbations. Hence, the mapper graph can highlight regions in the feature space that are potentially less stable or robust.
    6. **Insight into Data Structure**: The connections between the nodes in the mapper graph indicate transitions between different magnitudes of feature vectors. This can show how data points transition from low to high feature intensities, providing insights into the overall structure of the data set.
    
    Using the L2 norm as a filter function is particularly useful for visualizing and understanding the intrinsic geometry of the data, as well as the behavior of machine learning models in response to the input data's magnitude. It can help highlight areas where a model might be paying more attention or reacting more strongly, which could be critical for tasks like feature selection, model interpretation, and identifying data regions that might need further investigation.
    
- can clustering not show relations between clusters? can you not make a graph from clustering?
    
    Clustering can indeed reveal relationships between data points by grouping them based on similarity, and under certain conditions, it can also hint at the relationships between clusters themselves. However, traditional clustering techniques often focus on creating distinct groups without explicitly mapping the relationships or connections between these groups. That said, it is possible to derive relationships between clusters and even construct a graph from clustering results, though it may require additional steps or methods beyond the initial clustering. Here's how:
    
    ### Making a Graph from Clustering
    
    1. **Hierarchical Clustering**: This method inherently provides a structure (a dendrogram) that can be interpreted as a graph showing the relationships between clusters at different levels of granularity. The dendrogram illustrates how clusters are merged or split as the threshold for similarity changes, which directly shows the relationships between clusters.
    2. **Nearest Neighbor Graphs**: After performing any clustering technique, you can construct a nearest neighbor graph where each cluster is represented by a node, and edges are drawn between nodes based on the nearest neighbor relationships between clusters. This could be based on the closest points in different clusters, centroid distances, or other metrics.
    3. **Overlap or Shared Membership**: In fuzzy clustering where data points may belong to multiple clusters with different degrees of membership, you can construct a graph where edges represent shared data points or significant overlap in membership functions, indicating a relationship between the clusters.
    4. **Proximity Networks**: For clusters formed in spatial or feature space, a proximity network can be built by connecting clusters that are within a certain distance of each other. This distance could be defined in various ways, such as the distance between centroids or the minimum distance between points in different clusters.
    
    ### Limitations and Comparisons with Mapper
    
    While these methods can show relationships between clusters, the mapper algorithm offers a unique approach by:
    
    - **Preserving Topological Features**: Mapper can capture the shape of the data, including loops and voids, which traditional clustering and subsequent graph construction might not reveal.
    - **Providing Multi-Scale Clustering**: Mapper allows for clustering at different resolutions simultaneously, thanks to its use of filter functions and covers, offering a more comprehensive view of the data's structure.
    - **Explicitly Mapping Overlap and Connectivity**: By design, mapper creates a graph that explicitly represents connections and overlaps between clusters (nodes), which is directly informative of the data’s underlying topology.
    
    In summary, while traditional clustering can be adapted to reveal some relationships between clusters, the mapper algorithm is specifically designed to explore and visualize these relationships as part of its core methodology, capturing a richer, more nuanced view of the data’s topological structure.

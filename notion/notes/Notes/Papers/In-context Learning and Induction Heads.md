# In-context Learning and Induction Heads

- What are induction heads and in-context learning? Relation to analogy making?
    
    > *induction head*, a circuit whose function is to look back over the sequence for previous instances of the current token (call it `A`), find the token that came after it last time (call it `B`), and then predict that the same completion will occur again (e.g. forming the sequence `[A][B] … [A] → [B]`)
    > 
    
    Similar to analogies, but find complete using exact same token, not analogous one
    
    > Mechanically, induction heads in our models are implemented by a circuit of two attention heads: the first head is a “previous token head” which copies information from the previous token into the next token, while the second head (the actual “induction head”) uses that information to find tokens preceded by the present token.
    > 
    
    > When induction heads occur in sufficiently large models and operate on sufficiently abstract representations, the very same heads that do this sequence copying *also* take on a more expanded role of *analogical sequence copying* or *in-context nearest neighbors.* 
    By this we mean that they promote sequence completions like `[A*][B*] … [A] → [B]` where `A*` is not exactly the same token as `A` but similar in some embedding space, and also `B` is not exactly the same token as `B*`.

    THIS is completing analogies ?

    inductive reasoning: by going from the specific to the general.
    

For example, given “The cat sat on the mat. The cat …”, induction heads will promote the continuation “sat on the mat”.

- For transformers, what's nats ?
    
    In the context of transformers, "nats" refers to a unit of measurement called "natural units" or "nats" (short for natural logarithm units). It is a logarithmic scale used to measure the amount of information or entropy in a probability distribution.
    
    The term "nats" comes from the natural logarithm, which is denoted as "ln" and has a base of "e" (approximately 2.71828). In contrast to nats, another commonly used unit of measurement for information is "bits," which is based on the binary logarithm with a base of 2.
    
    In the context of transformers, nats are often used to quantify the entropy or uncertainty associated with the predicted probability distributions over different tokens in language models. When training a transformer model, the goal is often to minimize the cross-entropy loss, which is typically measured in nats. This loss function encourages the model to assign higher probabilities to the correct tokens and lower probabilities to incorrect ones during training.
    
    Nats provide a convenient way to measure information and model performance, and they are particularly useful when dealing with logarithmic quantities and probability distributions.
    
- What's an example of comparing nats?
    
    Comparing nats involves comparing the entropy or uncertainty associated with different probability distributions. Here's an example to illustrate the concept:
    
    Let's consider two probability distributions A and B over a set of three events: {E1, E2, E3}. The probabilities associated with each event for distribution A are {0.6, 0.2, 0.2}, and for distribution B, they are {0.4, 0.4, 0.2}.
    
    To compare these distributions in terms of nats, we can calculate the entropy for each distribution using the formula:
    
    Entropy = -Σ(p(x) * log(p(x)))
    
    where p(x) is the probability of event x.
    
    For distribution A:
    Entropy(A) = -(0.6 * log(0.6) + 0.2 * log(0.2) + 0.2 * log(0.2))
    ≈ 1.281 nats
    
    For distribution B:
    Entropy(B) = -(0.4 * log(0.4) + 0.4 * log(0.4) + 0.2 * log(0.2))
    ≈ 1.485 nats
    
    From these calculations, we can see that distribution B has a higher entropy (uncertainty) compared to distribution A, as it has a more uniform probability distribution. This means that distribution B is less predictable or has more information content compared to distribution A.
    
    By comparing the entropy (measured in nats) of different probability distributions, we can evaluate the level of uncertainty or information content associated with each distribution.
    
- How to measure cross entropy loss of transformers in nats?
    
    The cross-entropy loss of transformers is typically measured in nats. Here's an overview of how it is calculated:
    
    1. Probability Distribution: Transformers generate probability distributions over the possible tokens in a sequence. These distributions represent the model's predictions for each token position.
    2. True Labels: During training, you have the ground truth or true labels for each token position in the sequence.
    3. Cross-Entropy Loss Calculation: To measure the model's performance, you calculate the cross-entropy loss between the predicted probability distribution and the true labels.
        
        a. For each token position, you have the predicted probability distribution over the tokens.
        
        b. You extract the true label for that token position.
        
        c. You calculate the negative log-likelihood of the true label under the predicted distribution.
        
        d. Repeat this process for all token positions and average the losses.
        
    4. Conversion to Nats: The resulting loss value is typically reported in nats. This conversion is achieved by dividing the calculated loss by the natural logarithm of the base of the probability distribution.
        
        Cross-Entropy Loss in Nats = Cross-Entropy Loss in Bits / ln(2)
        
        Here, ln(2) is the natural logarithm of 2, which is approximately 0.6931.
        
    
    By measuring the cross-entropy loss in nats, you can assess the model's ability to predict the true labels and minimize the uncertainty or entropy associated with the token distributions.
    

We verify that these heads score highly on our [“copying” and “prefix matching” evaluations](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2022/in-context-learning-and-induction-heads/index.html#head-activation-evaluators) (that is, they increase the probability of the token they attend to, and attend to tokens where the prefix matches the present token on random text)

Prefix Matching: “node” (A) is the prefix. “structuion” (B) is copied

• **Copying.** Does the head’s direct effect on the residual stream increase the logits of the same token as the one being attended to?

- What does it mean for an attention head to “copy a token”?
    
    When an attention head "copies a token," it means that it assigns a relatively high attention weight to a specific token in the input sequence, indicating that the information from that token is considered important for further processing. In other words, the attention head is focused on that particular token and will incorporate its information into subsequent computations (to the output)
    
    When the model copies a token B, it is more likely to output B again.
    

Since we'reusing PCA, each direction can be thought of as a vector of log-likelihoods that models are movingalong

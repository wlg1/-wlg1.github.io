- why use hadamard, not matrix multipliation?
    
    Using the Hadamard product (element-wise multiplication) rather than standard matrix multiplication in this context is crucial for computing the individual contribution of each weight to the gradient of the loss function. Here's why the Hadamard product is used:
    
    1. **Individual Contributions**: The goal of the SNIP score is to evaluate the importance of each individual weight in the network by approximating how the loss would change if that particular weight were set to zero. The Hadamard product allows for this by multiplying each element of the weight matrix \( |W| \) with the corresponding element of the gradient of the loss with respect to that weight \( \nabla_{W_{ij}} \mathcal{L}(x) \). This results in a new matrix where each element reflects the contribution of each individual weight to the loss, preserving the direct correspondence between each weight and its derivative.
    2. **Preservation of Dimensionality**: Hadamard product operates directly on matrices of the same size, producing another matrix of the same size where each element is the product of corresponding elements from the two input matrices. This preserves the structure of the weight matrix, making it straightforward to map back each product to its specific weight in the network.
    3. **Independent Scaling**: The Hadamard product scales each weight independently based on its gradient. In contrast, standard matrix multiplication would mix the contributions of different weights, thus not suitable for assessing the impact of individual weights independently. Standard matrix multiplication combines elements across the entire row and column, which is useful for transforming data or changing dimensions but does not provide a clear, direct measure of individual parameter importance.
    
    By using the Hadamard product, the computation reflects a direct, element-wise interaction between the magnitude of each weight and how much a small change in it impacts the loss, which is exactly what the SNIP method aims to quantify. This helps in deciding which weights might be pruned (removed) with minimal impact on the model's performance, based on their individual contributions to the loss function.
    
- generalize this reasoning of why use hadamard
    1. **Preservation of Correspondence**: The Hadamard product maintains a direct one-to-one correspondence between elements in two matrices. This is crucial when the interaction or the relationship between corresponding elements of matrices needs to be considered individually. **Each output element is solely dependent on the corresponding input elements, and not influenced by other elements in the matrices.**
    2. **Element-Specific Operations**: When the analysis or operation requires modifying or analyzing each element independently based on a similar element in another matrix, the Hadamard product is the appropriate choice. This is seen in operations like weighting elements individually, applying masks or filters, or performing element-specific scaling.
    3. **Maintaining Dimensionality**: The Hadamard product does not alter the dimensions of the original matrices, which is important for maintaining the structural integrity in many machine learning algorithms. Each input matrix's shape is preserved in the output, which is essential for layer-wise operations in neural networks where the weight matrices must maintain specific dimensions.
    4. **Application in Gradient Operations**: In optimization and learning algorithms, element-wise operations are used to update parameters directly corresponding to their gradient values. The Hadamard product allows each parameter to be updated independently based on its own gradient, supporting fine-grained control over learning processes.
    5. **Simplicity and Interpretability**: Operations using the Hadamard product are often more straightforward to implement and interpret compared to matrix multiplication, which involves dot products and can mix contributions across an entire matrix. This simplicity is valuable in debugging and understanding the behavior of algorithms.
    6. **Efficiency in Sparse Matrices**: When dealing with sparse matrices (matrices with a large number of zero elements), the Hadamard product is computationally efficient as it only operates on the non-zero elements, whereas matrix multiplication might involve unnecessary computations involving zeros.

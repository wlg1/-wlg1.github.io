How a Computer Broke a 50-Year Math Record

straussen for large: 8 to 7 steps. nxn into nested 2x2. 67% less MM.

Deepmind alphatensor: beat straussen using nxn into 4x4. built on alpahzero

7m: 2d matrix multp can be represented as 3D tensor
tensor decomp into building blocks. each rank-1 tensor is an MM step. these all add back up into 3d tensor. the goal is to use as few rank-1 tensor as poss

give each rank-1 tensor a cost

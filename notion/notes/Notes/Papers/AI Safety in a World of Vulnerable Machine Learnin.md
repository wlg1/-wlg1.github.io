# AI Safety in a World of Vulnerable Machine Learning Systems

The main ML system is the primary system that takes actions in the world (e.g. interacting with users), with the helper ML systems acting as scaffolding to train and/or verify the main ML system.

. Conversely, it is less likely to happen if the optimization process is pursuing a goal that is largely independent from the helper’s output, such as if the helper is an interpretability tool checking for the presence of mesa-optimization.

Example: Natural selection is an optimization process that optimizes for reproductive fitness. Natural selection produced humans, who are themselves optimizers. Humans are therefore mesa-optimizers of natural selection.

one might wish to use mechanistic interpretability as part of [human-in-the-loop training](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.11571.pdf) to produce models that learn human-like representations.

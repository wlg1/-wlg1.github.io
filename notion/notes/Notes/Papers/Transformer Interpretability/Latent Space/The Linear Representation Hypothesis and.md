The input space is in red. Each vector subtracts “He is the” from: She - He , French - English 

Prompts: “She is the…” and French translation of “He is the” MINUS “He is the”

We can think of the center zero vector being “He is the” vector ?

The output space is in blue.

Answers: “Queen” and the French translation of “He” MINUS “king”

We can think of the center zero vector being “King” vector ?

By taking the causal inner product between the input and output vectors, we get the concept vector  that is mostly orthogonal from other concept vectors

Each concept variable W differs only by its counterfactual (opposites) values, such as male - female. Each W has a set of counterfactual outputs (eg. father-mother, king-queen).

Not all concept vectors are causally separable (eg. english-french and english-russian). 

Define causal inner product in terms of statistical dependency between words

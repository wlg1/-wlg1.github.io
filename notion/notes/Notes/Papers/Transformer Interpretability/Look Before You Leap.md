# Look Before You Leap

case study: too narrow (eg. bob and mary )
constellation: diff datasets with sim struc and connect them. run causal analysis on 4 case studies at same time (make case studies more scalable instead of redoing them)

eg. abstract request can be repr as NL or code (each is a node in constellation)

Request patching

L1 is no change, L3 is hard code, but L2 allows it to adapt

Use last token pos as it combines both context part and request part of input.

Normalized token prob: varies as model is more confident in token T

Questions:

- Interchange vs resampling?
- Why constellation works to make scalable

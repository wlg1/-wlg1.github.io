# Neural Networks Learn Statistics of Increasing Complexity

Quantile normalization: Match CDF quantile intensities of dog pixel to goldfish pixel. This optimally transforms a distribution of real numbers to another 

A higher order moment of a boolean vector is just logical conjunction (AND) chains. Implementing AND statements may require multiple layers (each layer has AND statement)

Started with trying to erase features; can we manipulate moments of activations to manipulate what it learns?

Formalizing the presumption of independence: what does it mean to interpret a model to make claims about what it will do in a situation? Uses cumulants (alternative to moments); exp many cumulants so model only learns a handful

Gaussian is max entropy distribution given mean and var

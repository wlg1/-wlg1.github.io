# Rigorously Testing Interpretability Hypotheses Using Causal Scrubbing

1: Introduction

p4: 

● In Motivation, formalization, examples, we give a detailed explanation of the causal
scrubbing algorithm and the reasons for various design choices we made.
● In Causal scrubbing on a paren balance checker, we apply causal scrubbing to
evaluate an interpretation of how a small transformer checks if parentheses are
balanced.
● In Causal scrubbing on induction heads, we use causal scrubbing to study induction
heads on a two-layer attention-only language model.

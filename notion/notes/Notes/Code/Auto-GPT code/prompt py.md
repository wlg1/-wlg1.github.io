- config()
    
    The line **`cfg = Config()`** creates an instance of a class called **`Config`** and assigns it to the variable **`cfg`**.
    
    Assuming that **`Config`** is a custom class defined in the code you're working with, it's likely that the purpose of creating an instance of this class is to store and organize various configuration settings for the program. These settings might include things like paths to input and output files, thresholds for certain operations, or other parameters that can be adjusted to modify the behavior of the program.

- **Prepare all vector data for upload**
    
    What does this do?
    # create embeddings
        if is_multiprocess:
            pool = model.start_multi_process_pool()
            vector_values = model.encode_multi_process(df_chunk['text_to_encode'], pool).tolist()
            model.stop_multi_process_pool(pool)
        else:
            vector_values = model.encode(df_chunk['text_to_encode'], show_progress_bar=True).tolist()

    This code snippet creates embeddings for a set of text data using a pre-trained model. The embeddings are numerical representations of the text data that can be used in machine learning and natural language processing tasks, such as text classification or similarity matching.
    
    The code first checks whether the **`is_multiprocess`** variable is True. If it is, the code creates a multiprocessing pool using the **`start_multi_process_pool()`** function of the pre-trained model. Multiprocessing allows the code to take advantage of multiple CPU cores to speed up the encoding process.
    
    The **`encode_multi_process()`** function of the pre-trained model is then used to encode the text data in parallel using the multiprocessing pool. The text data is passed in as a pandas Series object, **`df_chunk['text_to_encode']`**, and the resulting embeddings are converted to a list using the **`tolist()`** function.
    
    If **`is_multiprocess`** is False, the code uses the **`encode()`** function of the pre-trained model to encode the text data in a single process. The **`show_progress_bar`** parameter is set to True to display a progress bar while the encoding is in progress.
    
    Overall, this code is used to generate embeddings for a large amount of text data efficiently, either using multiprocessing or a single process, depending on the value of the **`is_multiprocess`** variable.
    
- Why Upload data to Pinecone in asynchronous batches?
    
    Uploading data to Pinecone in asynchronous batches can offer several benefits over uploading data synchronously, particularly when dealing with large volumes of data. Here are some reasons why:
    
    1. Improved performance: Uploading data in asynchronous batches can help improve the performance of the upload process by reducing the amount of time spent waiting for individual requests to complete. By sending multiple requests in parallel, you can take better advantage of the available network bandwidth and reduce the overall upload time.
    2. Reduced memory usage: Uploading large volumes of data synchronously can require a significant amount of memory, which may not be practical for some applications. By breaking up the data into smaller batches and uploading them asynchronously, you can reduce the memory requirements and avoid potential memory issues.
    3. Better fault tolerance: Uploading data asynchronously can help improve the fault tolerance of the upload process. If a single request fails, it won't necessarily cause the entire upload process to fail, and you can retry the failed request without having to start the entire upload process over again.
    4. Easier progress monitoring: Asynchronous batch uploading can make it easier to monitor the progress of the upload process, as you can track the progress of individual batches rather than having to wait for the entire upload to complete. This can be particularly useful when dealing with large volumes of data.

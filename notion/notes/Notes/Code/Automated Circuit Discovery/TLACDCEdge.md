- overall
    1. **EdgeType Class:**
        - `class EdgeType(Enum)`: Defines an enumeration `EdgeType`, a subclass of `Enum`. This is used to categorize types of edges in a computational graph.
            - `ADDITION = 0`: An enum member representing the addition operation in the graph.
            - `DIRECT_COMPUTATION = 1`: Represents direct computation from a parent node to a child node.
            - `PLACEHOLDER = 2`: Used for edges where there are multiple parents, acting as placeholders in the graph.
            - `__eq__(self, other)`: Overrides the equality method to handle a specific error related to module reloading. It ensures the comparison is done based on the enum's value.
    2. **Edge Class:**
        - `class Edge`: Defines a class `Edge` representing an edge in the computational graph.
            - `__init__`: Constructor that initializes an `Edge` instance with its type (`edge_type`), a boolean indicating its presence (`present`), and an optional float for the effect size (`effect_size`).
            - `__repr__`: Overrides the representation method to provide a formatted string output for `Edge` instances.
    3. **TorchIndex Class:**
        - `class TorchIndex`: Defines a class `TorchIndex` to handle indices in PyTorch tensors, particularly for parts of a tensor affected by operations in the computational graph.
            - `__init__`: Constructor that takes a list of items (`list_of_things_in_tuple`) which could be `None`, integers, or lists of integers. These items are used to create an index into a tensor (`as_index`) and a hashable tuple (`hashable_tuple`) for use as dictionary keys.
            - `__hash__`: Overrides the hash method to make `TorchIndex` instances hashable.
            - `__eq__`: Overrides the equality method for comparing `TorchIndex` instances.
            - `__repr__` and `graphviz_index`: These methods provide string representations of the `TorchIndex` instance, useful for debugging and visualization (e.g., with Graphviz).
- why use addition, DIRECT_COMPUTATION, etc
    1. **ADDITION (`EdgeType.ADDITION`):**
        - **Purpose:** This type represents edges in the computational graph where the operation is summation. In neural networks, particularly those with residual connections (like many transformer architectures), addition is a common operation. For example, in a residual block, the output is often the sum of the input and some transformation of the input.
        - **Use Case:** By labeling an edge as `ADDITION`, the system can recognize that the child node is a sum of its parent nodes. This is essential for correctly interpreting and manipulating these sum operations during analysis or modifications of the network.
    2. **DIRECT_COMPUTATION (`EdgeType.DIRECT_COMPUTATION`):**
        - **Purpose:** This type is used for edges where the child node is a direct function of the parent node. This covers a wide range of operations, from simple linear transformations to more complex functions like activation functions or normalization.
        - **Use Case:** Identifying an edge as `DIRECT_COMPUTATION` helps in understanding that the child node's value is computed directly from the parent node without additional inputs or complex interactions. This simplification is useful for tracing dependencies and effects within the network.
    3. **PLACEHOLDER (`EdgeType.PLACEHOLDER`):**
        - **Purpose:** This type is somewhat different; it's used in situations where the relationship between nodes is more complex or involves multiple parent nodes. It's a way to keep track of these more complex interactions without specifying the exact nature of the computation.
        - **Use Case:** In cases where multiple nodes contribute to the computation of a child node, a `PLACEHOLDER` type can be used to represent these edges. This is especially useful in transformers where operations like attention involve interactions between multiple nodes (queries, keys, and values).

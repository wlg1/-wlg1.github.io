# Google services

- When attachments in gmail are sent as google drive links, where in my drive can i find these files? No, I'm the sender; No, they weren't on drive. I uploaded them from my computer and sent them, and theywere too large so they were sent as google drive links. Where on my drive are they stored?
    
    They are just stored in the main folder (make sure youâ€™re using the right email)

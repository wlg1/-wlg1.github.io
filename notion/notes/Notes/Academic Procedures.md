- Is it better to submit to a journal or conference?
    
    Deciding whether to submit your work to a journal or a conference depends on several factors and considerations. Here are some points to help you make an informed decision:
    
    1. Conference Advantages:
        - Faster publication: Conferences typically have shorter review cycles, and accepted papers are published and presented at the conference within a relatively shorter time frame compared to journals.
        - Timeliness: Conferences are an excellent venue for presenting cutting-edge research and addressing current challenges or trends in your field.
        - Networking and collaboration: Conferences offer opportunities to connect with researchers, experts, and industry professionals in your field, facilitating collaboration and future research prospects.
        - Broad audience: Conferences often attract a diverse audience, including researchers, practitioners, and industry representatives, allowing for more exposure and potential impact of your work.
    2. Journal Advantages:
        - Rigorous peer review: Journals usually have a more extensive peer-review process, which can provide more detailed feedback and ensure a higher level of scrutiny and quality control.
        - Longer format: Journals typically allow for more comprehensive and in-depth presentations of your research, including detailed methodology, analysis, and discussion.
        - Permanence and archival: Published journal articles are typically considered more permanent and citable, contributing to the long-term visibility and impact of your work.
        - Discipline-specific focus: Journals often have a narrower focus within a specific discipline, which can be beneficial if you want to target a specific audience or engage in detailed discussions within your research area.
        
        Some researchers choose to submit their work to conferences initially to gain early feedback and visibility and then later submit an extended version or a follow-up paper to a journal. Others may prioritize immediate dissemination of their results and opt for conferences, while others prioritize the depth and thoroughness of their work and choose journals. 
        
- How do you plan which conference or journal to submit to? Why not just the top?
    1. Relevance: Look for conferences or journals that align closely with the topic and scope of your research. Consider the target audience and whether your work will contribute to the ongoing discussions and advancements in that particular field.
    2. Impact and Prestige: While top conferences and journals generally have a higher reputation and impact, they are often highly competitive and have rigorous acceptance criteria. Assess the significance of your research and its potential impact to determine if it merits submission to these top-tier venues. If your work is novel but may not meet the highest standards, you can consider reputable but slightly less competitive conferences or journals.
    3. Targeted Audience: Consider the readership and attendees of the conference or journal. Will your work benefit from reaching a broad audience or a specialized community? Depending on your research goals, it may be more beneficial to submit to a conference or journal that specifically caters to the niche area you are addressing.
    4. Timeliness: Evaluate the submission deadlines and publication schedules of conferences and journals. If you need to disseminate your findings quickly or align with a particular event or trend, choose venues with shorter publication cycles or conferences that occur earlier in the year.
    5. Open Access Options: Consider whether the conference or journal provides open access options or if it aligns with your publishing preferences. Open access can enhance the visibility and accessibility of your research to a wider audience.
    6. Peer Review Process: Investigate the rigor and reputation of the peer review process. Some conferences and journals may have a more thorough and rigorous review process, which can improve the quality of published work.
    7. Track Record and Reputation: Research the previous papers published in the conference or journal you are considering. Assess the quality and relevance of the papers to ensure it aligns with your expectations and goals.
    8. Cost and Budget: Be mindful of any associated fees for submission, publication, or conference attendance. Top-tier conferences or journals may have higher costs, which may impact your decision depending on your available resources.
    
- Poster vs paper at a conf
    
    [https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/194018/what-is-the-difference-between-paper-presentation-and-poster-presentation-in-te](https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/194018/what-is-the-difference-between-paper-presentation-and-poster-presentation-in-te#:~:text=A%20paper%20presentation%20almost%20certainly,some%20feedback%20from%20conference%20attendees)
    
    This probably depends on the field, but in CS, at least, a paper presentation is much more valued than a poster. Moreover, conferences are thought of as more valuable than journal publications due to the sorter time scale between submission and the conference vs submission and final publication.
    
    A paper presentation almost certainly gets more review than a poster, even with short time scales. Posters may be most valuable to students looking to get a start on making their, not quite ready, work visible and getting some feedback from conference attendees.
    
    Moreover, it may be (or not) that the papers are published in the proceedings or an associated journal that doesn't include posters.
    
    For some purposes one can do both, actually, even at the same conferences. The paper is expected to be more refined and complete, however.

Add acknowledgements after peer review or a later vers of arxiv, no need to put them on first arxiv or review vers, as you'd need to ask them if they want to be in acknowledgements and they'd want to read the paper

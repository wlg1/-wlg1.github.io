Van der Pol and the history of relaxation oscillations: toward the emergence of a concept

- History
    
    Van der Pol found stable oscillations,[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_der_Pol_oscillator#cite_note-3) which he subsequently called [relaxation-oscillations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relaxation_oscillator)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_der_Pol_oscillator#cite_note-relax-4) and are now known as a type of [limit cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limit_cycle), in [electrical circuits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_circuit) employing [vacuum tubes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_tube). When these circuits are driven near the [limit cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limit_cycle), they become [entrained](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrainment_(physics)), i.e. the driving [signal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_(electrical_engineering)) pulls the current along with it. Van der Pol and his colleague, van der Mark, reported in the September 1927 issue of [*Nature*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_(journal)) that at certain drive [frequencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency) an irregular [noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise_(electronic)) was heard,[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_der_Pol_oscillator#cite_note-Nature-5) which was later found to be the result of [deterministic chaos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory).[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_der_Pol_oscillator#cite_note-6)
    
    The Van der Pol equation has a long history of being used in both the [physical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_science) and [biological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology) [sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science). For instance, in biology, Fitzhugh[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_der_Pol_oscillator#cite_note-fitz-7) and Nagumo[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_der_Pol_oscillator#cite_note-nag-8) extended the equation in a [planar field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(mathematics)) as a [model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FitzHugh%E2%80%93Nagumo_model) for [action potentials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential) of [neurons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurons).

This describes the system of a SINGLE NEURON (voltage through its membrane):

The flow of electricity across the membrane can be well modelled by a system of three interdependent differential equations. These describe the change over time in the speed at which the voltage across the membrane changes, and two other variables: fast channel current and slow channel current.

The model accurately predicts the behaviour of an isolated neurone observed in a lab as the experimenter forces the voltage up [varies inputs]

Figure 3: The mutually inhibited six-neurone circuit controlling the leech heart. Each half of the neural network produces the series of bursts shown at the bottom. Here neurones 1, 3, and 5 are firing while the others are silent. The spikes within each burst get increasingly erratic.

…Without the control of periodic inhibition the neurones would all quickly degenerate into erratic behaviour.

This erratic output is thought to come from the same CPG that normally produces the very regular rhythm for stable flight. Somehow the moth can trigger it to go chaotic instead, generating erratic wing-muscle twitches that help it dodge predators.

how the moth's CPG is wired up to enable it to flip-flop between these two behaviours?

Other researchers think that the uncontrolled muscle spasms during an epileptic fit are due to neural networks in certain regions of the brain degenerating into a chaotic pattern.

Early research into systems of differential equations with more than three variables found that chaotic behaviour is all but inevitable for large swathes of the phase-space. Despite this, complex biological systems such as networks of nerve cells have evolved to tame chaos in order to produce the patterned output crucial for all animal behaviour. In fact, it is starting to seem that neurones have even gone a step further, and harnessed the powers of chaos to make neural circuits much more versatile and quick to adapt.

They are the source of the tightly-coupled patterns of neural activity that drive rhythmic and stereotyped motor behaviors like walking

# Eleuther Discord Archives

Main aim: how do I contribute? How did others do it before, and what was needed? How did they get started? (DM them so it won’t be lost in chat)

Hi, I read your posts in the Eleuther AI discord about contributing to a project. I'm looking to collaborate on a project but don't know how to get started. How did you find a project to contribute to; was it posted or did you ask around for it? Thanks!

- if they don’t want to be seen publically, give an example of abstraction. Eg) in a hypothetical discord, say want X. Based on expr from talking to and observering others in rsch projs (anonymized for this video), this happened. This discord practice can also be applied to your own rsch discords.

- list out issues-[reasonings]-solns-generalize. who contributed?
*-transforms public hist into searchable format that flows from issue-soln (easy to read; few tangents that lose track of original issues) AND learn lessons for future (eg. good to know X subject, have Y type person work on feature b/c Y has less conflict, etc)
ask for new projs
not comprehsive; small lessons

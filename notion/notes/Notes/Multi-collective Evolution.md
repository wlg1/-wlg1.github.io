Composability [SQL](CS%20&%20SWE%20f7436b5aff924c04aa569007bb061038/SQL%20f6898703d8ef43f7a192c8e0324f73b5.md) 

- Composable tables for the following reasons (use normalization to minimize the following):
    1. Eliminating Redundancy to save space
    2. Preventing Update Anomalies: In a non-normalized or poorly normalized database, updating data may require modifications in multiple places. This increases the risk of inconsistencies and update anomalies. Normalization helps address these issues by structuring the data in a way that minimizes the need for redundant updates.
    3. Improving Data Integrity: Normalization helps enforce data integrity constraints, such as primary keys, foreign keys, and referential integrity. These constraints ensure that data is accurately represented, and relationships between entities are maintained. By adhering to normalization rules, the database can maintain reliable and consistent data.
    4. Enhancing Query Efficiency: Normalization improves the efficiency of database operations, such as querying, searching, and sorting. By reducing redundancy and organizing data logically, the database can process queries more efficiently. Normalization can also lead to smaller table sizes, which can improve disk space utilization and overall performance.
    5. Supporting Scalability and Flexibility: Normalized databases are generally more flexible and scalable. As the database evolves and new requirements arise, normalization allows for easier modification and expansion. Changes can be made to individual tables without affecting other parts of the database, promoting flexibility and adaptability.
    
    It's worth noting that normalization should be applied appropriately, based on the specific requirements and characteristics of the data being modeled. Over-normalization can lead to complex join operations and decreased performance. Therefore, striking a balance between normalization and denormalization is crucial, considering factors such as performance, data integrity, and ease of use.
    

One can generalize these reasons to use composability in other systems

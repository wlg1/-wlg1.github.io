# Fallacies

I think one thing to realize is that "reversion to a mean" does not mean that future flips have to "correct" for past results.
As an example, let's say I a coin ten times and get 10 heads: 10 / 10 heads
If I flip it 20 more times and 10 are heads: 20 / 30 \~ 67% have been heads
If I flip it 100 more times and 50 are heads: 60 / 110 \~ 55% have been heads
If I flip it 1000 more times and 500 are heads: 510 / 1010 \~ 50.5% have been heads
So you get a reversion to the mean without any "correction" in the other direction.

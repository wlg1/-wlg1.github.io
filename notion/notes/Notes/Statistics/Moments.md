First moment gives approximation of where dataset is relative to coordinate axis. But still too vague- could be many. Second moment narrows this to even fewer possible datasets.

SEcond moment: how far is it from the mean. This is why we subtract each point from the mean (subtract gives distance)

Third moment “removes” 1st and 2nd moment and says what is the “extra effect” of the third moment

If there are 300 million people in a country, and 100 squirrels nibble on a people each year, and there are 70 million squirrels, what are the chances a person encountering a squirrel will be nibbled by it? Work out the probability steps, and state what factors are missing. Account for noise in statistics based on various factors.

### Given Data

1. **Total population of the country**: 300 million people
2. **Number of people nibbled by squirrels each year**: 100
3. **Total squirrel population**: 70 million (Note: This data is not directly used in the calculation for probability of a person being nibbled but is relevant for understanding the context)

### Calculation Steps

### Step 1: Basic Probability Calculation

To find the basic probability of a person being nibbled by a squirrel, we use the formula:

$\text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of nibble events}}{\text{Total population}}$

Using the given numbers:
$\text{Probability} = \frac{100}{300,000,000}$

### Step 2: Performing the Calculation

We substitute the numbers into the formula:
$\text{Probability} = \frac{100}{300,000,000} \approx 3.33 \times 10^{-7}$

This gives us the basic probability of a person being nibbled by a squirrel in the country.

### Explanation of Missing Factors

However, this calculation does not account for various factors that could significantly influence the probability:

- **Distribution of squirrels**: If squirrels are concentrated in certain areas, people in those areas would have a higher risk.
- **Human-squirrel interaction frequency**: Not everyone has the same likelihood of encountering squirrels. For example, people living in urban areas might encounter them less often than those in rural areas.
- **Behavioral aspects**: Some squirrels might be more inclined to nibble than others, influenced by factors like availability of food, human interaction, etc.
- **Seasonal changes**: Squirrel behavior and human activities might change with seasons, affecting the frequency of encounters.
- **Reporting accuracy**: The number 100 is based on reported nibbles, but not all such events may be reported.
- **Statistical noise**: There are always random variations and other unaccounted factors in any statistical data.

These factors introduce complexities and uncertainties that are not captured in the basic probability calculation. Therefore, the actual probability in real-world scenarios might be different.

- how are statistics like you're less likely to be bitten by a shark than x calculated?
    
    Statistics like "you're less likely to be bitten by a shark than [some other event]" are calculated using comparative risk assessment. Here's how it's typically done:
    
    ### Steps in Calculating Comparative Risk Statistics
    
    1. **Gather Data**: Collect data on the number of shark bites and the number of occurrences of the event being compared (e.g., being struck by lightning, involved in a car accident). This data usually comes from official reports, research studies, and databases maintained by relevant organizations.
    2. **Calculate Individual Probabilities**: Determine the probability of each event happening. This is typically done by dividing the number of occurrences by a relevant population number. For shark bites, it would be the number of bites divided by the number of people swimming in the ocean. For car accidents, it's the number of accidents divided by the number of drivers or vehicle miles traveled.
    3. **Compare Probabilities**: Once you have the probabilities, you can compare them directly to make a statement like "you're more likely to experience X than be bitten by a shark."
    
    ### Accuracy and Limitations
    
    1. **Data Quality**: The accuracy of these statistics heavily depends on the quality and completeness of the data used. Underreporting or overreporting can skew results.
    2. **Context-Specific**: These probabilities are averages and don't account for personal risk factors. For example, a surfer in shark-infested waters has a higher risk of a shark bite than an average person.
    3. **Time and Location Factors**: Risks can vary over time and by location. The probability of a shark bite is higher in areas with more sharks, and car accident risks vary by country and even within different regions of the same country.
    4. **Changing Conditions**: Both shark behavior and human activities change, which can affect the probability of events over time.
    5. **Misleading Comparisons**: Sometimes, these comparisons can be misleading. Low-probability events like shark bites are often compared with higher-probability, but less sensational, events to make a point about irrational fears.
    6. **Statistical Interpretation**: The way statistics are presented can influence how they're interpreted. Saying "you're more likely to be struck by lightning than bitten by a shark" emphasizes the rarity of shark bites, but it doesn't mean shark bites are not a concern for specific groups or in certain areas.
    
    In summary, while these comparative risk statistics can provide a broad perspective on the likelihood of rare events like shark bites, they should be interpreted with caution. They offer an average risk assessment but don't account for individual circumstances, location, time, and other critical factors.

2) Calculate a contingent probability.

Based on #1, it would make more sense to do a simple poll of a random sample of people to determine how many people have been to a beach in their lifetime. The random sample of people should provide a good benchmark for the proportion of population that goes to the beach. Then, in addition, you need some beach metrics for average attendance per year. This will allow you to extrapolate the average number of beach visits per beachgoer. Finally, take the number of shark attacks and calculate a simple probability...

What is the probability of a random beach-goer being attacked by a shark in a single beach visit? P{Attack | Visit}

With that answer...and the information for average number of visits per beachgoer, you can calculate the probability that an average person will not be attacked in any visit. The probability of attack is 1 minus that.

- how would this probability change if you were to also account for how often people go swimming? how to calculate this?
    
    To account for the frequency of swimming in calculating the probability of a shark bite, you would need to refine the data to be more specific to the population at risk. Here's how you could approach it:
    
    ### Steps to Include Swimming Frequency in Shark Bite Probability Calculation
    
    1. **Gather Specific Data**:
        - **Number of Shark Bites**: Get the annual number of recorded shark bites.
        - **Swimming Population**: Determine how many people go swimming in areas where shark bites could occur. This could be a total number of swimmers or swimmer-days per year (a measure of how many people swim on any given day, summed over the year).
        - **Frequency of Swimming**: Estimate how often an average person goes swimming. This could be the average number of swimming sessions per person per year.
    2. **Calculate Adjusted Probability**:
        - **Probability of Shark Bite per Swim**:
            - Use the number of shark bites divided by the total number of swimmer-sessions (or swimmer-days) to get the probability of a shark bite per swimming session.
        - **Adjusted Individual Risk**:
            - Multiply the probability of a shark bite per swim by the average number of times a person swims per year. This gives a more personalized risk assessment.
    
    ### Example Calculation
    
    Imagine the following scenario:
    
    - Annual shark bites: 100
    - Annual swimmer-days: 50 million (people swimming in shark-inhabited waters)
    - Average swimming frequency: 10 times per year
    
    **Step 1**: Calculate the probability of a shark bite per swim:
    $\text{Probability per swim} = \frac{\text{Number of shark bites}}{\text{Swimmer-days}} = \frac{100}{50,000,000}$
    
    **Step 2**: Calculate the adjusted individual risk:
    $\text{Adjusted risk} = \text{Probability per swim} \times \text{Average swimming frequency}$
    
    Let's perform these calculations.
    
    In our example scenario:
    
    1. **Probability of a Shark Bite Per Swim**:
        - The probability of a shark bite per swim is approximately $2 \times 10^{-6}$ or 0.0002%.
    2. **Adjusted Individual Risk**:
        - If an average person swims 10 times a year, their annual risk of being bitten by a shark is about $2 \times 10^{-5}$ or 0.002%.
    
    This calculation provides a more nuanced understanding of the risk. It shows that for individuals who swim frequently, the risk of a shark bite, while still low, is higher than what would be suggested by general population-based statistics. It's important to note that these calculations are still simplifications and the actual risk can be influenced by many factors, such as the specific location of swimming, the behavior of sharks in that area, seasonal variations, and personal behavior while swimming.

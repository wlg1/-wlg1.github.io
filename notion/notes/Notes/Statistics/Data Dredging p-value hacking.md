# Data Dredging / p-value hacking

Data dredging is bad if multiple tests run on FEW OR ONE dataset. One dataset is likely to have a few correlations, but many would not. So if reproducibles, is sound. The old dataset is supposed to give the hypothesis. The new ones test it. You shouldn't test on old dataset, hence you can't form conclusion based on results from old. Must be reproducibles in new predictions. Similar to over fitting on training data.

Odd that depends how you define extent of dataset. Odd that depends on rschers own uncertainty, but tree falls in forest regardless

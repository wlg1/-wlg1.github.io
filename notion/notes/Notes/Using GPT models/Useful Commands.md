# Useful Commands

[Use shift+enter for new line without submitting prompt]

Be less verbose in your responses (eg. don't repeat what you've just been told). respond yes if you understand

comment in detail how this code works, return all in one code block or file. make frequent in-line comments every few lines when best needed:

### Formatting

Remove all the timestamps in ** and turn into a single paragraph with no new lines:

remove the words ‘uh’ and ‘um’

Write a summary of this conversation, listing key points

Concisely, in three sentences or less,

Reply “yes”

this prevents long outputs. “yes” must be in quotes

- add-ons: if you understand.

<<<

Rewrite the exact thing you just wrote, but using $$ symbols around the latex math parts so they can be displayed in notion. Don't put spaces in between the $$ and the text it encloses. Don't start off with any comments, just rewrite it

### Critical Analysis

Use analogies. 

In simple terms,

Here are blog posts. Point out their contradictions, and make a table of them. 

Which argument do you think is correct? Back up your statements with reasons.

### Code

Explain this:

Here is the directory structure of a github repo as a json file

NOTE: if you include imports of files, it can often infer the dir struc w/o giving this file

Here is the documentation for [file/function]

Give an example of inputs to be used in the following code, and their outputs

or “specific variables” instead of ‘inputs’

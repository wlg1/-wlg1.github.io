# Relation to Graph NNs

- GPT-4 and chatgpt are wrong about this:
    
    In concise sentences, how are transformers graph neural networks?
    
    Transformers and graph neural networks (GNNs) are both deep learning architectures used for processing structured data. While they have similarities, they are not the same. Transformers are primarily used for natural language processing tasks, utilizing self-attention mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies in sequential data. GNNs, on the other hand, are designed for graph-structured data, capturing local and global information by processing nodes and edges in a graph. Transformers can be considered a specific type of GNN when adapted for graph data, but they are not inherently graph neural networks.

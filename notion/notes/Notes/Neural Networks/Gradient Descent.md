# Gradient Descent

Gradient is for multiple inputs (1st derivatives vector)
Jacobian is for multiple outputs (1st derivatives matrix)
Hessian is Jacobian on the Gradient (2nd derivatives matrix)

What is curvature? What does +/-, and big/small, curvature mean?

SOLN: The 2nd derivative- How the 1st derivative changes as the input is varied. Curvature has direction and magnitude. For direction: Curving upwards means speeding up (positive 2nd derivative), curving downwards means slowing down.

When acceleration is positive, this means that the speed at which the car is increasing speed is increasing. On a graph of the distance, this appears in the u-shape, which we can describe as the concave up curvature.
When acceleration is negative, this means that the speed at which the car is increasing speed is decreasing. On a graph representing the distance traveled, this would instead appear as an n-shape, which represents the concave down curvature.

For magnitude:

The sharper the turn, the smaller the radius. The ‘duller’ (fatter) it is, the longer it takes to go around it. So it’s 1/R. (see 3m)

Tangent vector directs where the point goes next. After a point moves, the tangent changes, too. So how will it change in the next step?

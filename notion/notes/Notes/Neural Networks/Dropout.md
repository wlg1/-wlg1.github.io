# Dropout

- Is dropout used during inference?
    
    In general, dropout is not used during inference in GPT models. Dropout is a regularization technique that is commonly used during the training of deep neural networks, including GPT models, to prevent overfitting.
    
    During training, dropout randomly drops out some of the neurons in the network, forcing the other neurons to learn more robust features that are not dependent on the presence of specific neurons. This helps to prevent overfitting and improve the generalization performance of the model.
    
    However, during inference, dropout is not typically used because it can introduce randomness and variability into the predictions, which is not desirable. Instead, the learned model parameters are used to make deterministic predictions.
    
    That being said, there are some variations of dropout, such as "test-time dropout" or "inverted dropout", that can be used during inference to simulate the effects of dropout and improve the robustness of the predictions. These methods involve scaling the weights of the model to compensate for the dropout during training, but they are not commonly used in GPT models.

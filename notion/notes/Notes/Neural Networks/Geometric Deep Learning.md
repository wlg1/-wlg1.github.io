****Lecture 9 (Manifolds)****

Euclidean space allows filter to move anywhere (globally)

But on a manifold, the way filter moves depends on the path you go on

On sphere, has rotation on path

On non-orientable surface (eg. mobius strip), path may not only rotate, but flip

5m50s: fixed path (geodesic), fixed gauge (no ambiguity in coord sys as itâ€™s precomputed)

parallel transport: move vector while preserving angle

10m: vectors are just abstract things that can be added/multiplied. to think of it as a direction, you need an inner product (hilbert space). To think of them as an array, you need a coordinate space (basis).

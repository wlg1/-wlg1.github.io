At top of Settings >> Output page is the Output mode which can be changed from advanced to simple and down from there in the Recording settings there is a Recordinjg Quality box usually set to "same as stream". Change that baby to anything else you like. Save it. Go back to your studio page and start recording. A pause button appears beside the recording button thing.

Change hotkeys, output folder

Do NOT use window capture- thatâ€™s only one window. use Screen Capture.

DO NOT use lower output resolution in video unsuitable for your needed resolution

what does lower fps value mean? in OBS, how much data in gb would 20 fps save vs 30 fps for a 1 hr video?

Let's say recording at 30 FPS for 1 hour produces a file of 3GB. If the file size was directly proportional to the FPS, recording at 20 FPS might produce a file that's roughly 2GB (1/3 less than 3GB). So you might save about 1GB in this hypothetical scenario.

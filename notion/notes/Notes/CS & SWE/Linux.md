When Linux dual boots with windows is it a VM?
<<<
When you dual boot Linux and Windows on the same machine, you are not running a virtual machine (VM). Instead, you are installing two separate operating systems side-by-side on the same physical hardware.

Dual booting typically involves creating separate partitions on your hard drive for each operating system and installing each OS on its own partition. When you start your computer, you can choose which operating system to boot into, usually via a boot menu.

In contrast, when you run a virtual machine (VM), you are running an instance of an operating system within another operating system, as a guest OS. The guest OS is typically installed on a virtual hard drive, which is actually just a file on the host machine's file system, and is managed by a virtualization layer that provides a virtual CPU, memory, and other hardware resources.

So, in summary, dual booting Linux and Windows on the same machine is not the same as running a virtual machine. Dual booting involves installing two separate operating systems side-by-side on the same physical hardware, while running a virtual machine involves running an instance of an operating system within another operating system as a guest OS.

# Fork

If a project is forked from another, don’t worry about how the project is “X commits ahead, Y commits behind” the forked original because this project is supposed to be a separate “cousin” to it that merely builds on top of some of it; it is not the same project.

Only care about the latest project’s main branch if it’s the same project

# GPU

- In colab, is all code faster with a GPU than without one?
    
    Not all code will necessarily be faster with a GPU in Colab. The benefit of using a GPU depends on the type of computations being performed in the code.
    
    GPUs excel at performing matrix operations and other parallelizable computations, making them particularly well-suited for deep learning tasks such as training neural networks. If your code involves heavy matrix operations or other computations that can be parallelized, it is likely that using a GPU will result in faster execution times compared to running the same code on a CPU.
    
    However, if your code involves primarily sequential operations, such as reading and writing files or executing loops with few computations, then using a GPU may not provide any significant speedup over a CPU.
    
    It's also worth noting that there are different types of GPUs with varying performance levels. In Colab, you can choose between a CPU runtime or a GPU runtime, and the GPU runtime offers two different GPU options: a Tesla K80 or a Tesla T4. The T4 is generally faster than the K80, so if you have the option to choose between the two, using the T4 is likely to result in faster execution times.

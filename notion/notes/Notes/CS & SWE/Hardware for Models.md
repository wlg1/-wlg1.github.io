# Hardware for Models

What hardware do I need to run gpt-3? How do I run it on the cloud, and what's an approximate cost?

Running GPT-3 requires a lot of computational power and memory, and it is not feasible to run it on a standard personal computer. Therefore, the best way to run GPT-3 is on the cloud. Here are the hardware requirements for running GPT-3:

- GPU: GPT-3 requires a GPU with at least 16GB of VRAM. The recommended GPUs are the Nvidia V100, A100, or T4.
- CPU: A CPU with at least 64 cores is recommended.
- Memory: GPT-3 requires a lot of memory, and the recommended amount is 1 TB or more.

To run GPT-3 on the cloud, you can use a service such as OpenAI's GPT-3 API or Microsoft's Azure AI. These services provide an interface for accessing GPT-3's capabilities without requiring you to set up the hardware and infrastructure necessary to run it.

The cost of running GPT-3 on the cloud varies depending on the provider and the amount of usage. OpenAI's GPT-3 API offers several pricing plans, ranging from $0 to $12,000 per month, depending on the number of requests and the complexity of the tasks performed. Microsoft's Azure AI offers a similar pricing model, with costs starting at $1.50 per hour for the basic tier and scaling up depending on usage. However, it is important to note that GPT-3 is a very powerful and complex AI model, and running it can quickly become expensive.

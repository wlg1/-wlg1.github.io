Creating the **init**.py file means that the my_sum folder can be imported as a module from the parent directory.

`if **name** == '**main**':`

`unittest.main()`

This is a command line entry point. It means that if you execute the script alone by running python [test.py](http://test.py/) at the command line, it will call unittest.main(). This executes the test runner by discovering all classes in this file that inherit from unittest.TestCase.

why are unit tests included in a test folder on a repo? how are they typically run /called?
    
    Unit tests are included in a test folder in a repository for several key reasons:
    
    1. **Organization and Clarity**: Placing unit tests in a separate test folder helps maintain a clear distinction between the application code and its associated tests. This separation aids in navigating the codebase, making it easier for developers to find and run tests.
    2. **Avoiding Conflicts**: Keeping tests in a separate directory ensures they do not interfere with the main application code. This is particularly important for avoiding namespace conflicts and ensuring that test code is not accidentally included in production builds.
    3. **Ease of Management**: Having a dedicated test folder simplifies the management of test scripts, especially in larger projects. It allows for easier tracking of what has been tested and what needs more coverage.
    4. **Integration with CI/CD**: Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines often look for tests in standard locations. A dedicated test folder aligns with these conventions, making it easier to set up automated testing.
    
    ### Running and Calling Unit Tests
    
    Unit tests are typically run using a test runner or a command-line interface specific to the programming language or framework being used. Here's a general approach:
    
    1. **Using a Test Framework**: Most programming languages have standard testing frameworks (like JUnit for Java, pytest for Python, or Mocha for JavaScript). These frameworks provide tools to easily define, organize, and run tests.
    2. **Command Line**: In many development environments, you can run tests from the command line. For instance, in a Python project using pytest, you might run `pytest` in your terminal. The test runner will automatically discover and execute tests in the test folder.
    3. **IDE Integration**: Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) often have built-in support for running tests. Developers can usually run tests directly from the IDE, often with convenient features like debugging and detailed reporting.
    4. **Automated via CI/CD Pipelines**: In a CI/CD setup, tests are often automatically run when code is pushed to a repository. Tools like Jenkins, Travis CI, or GitHub Actions can be configured to run the tests in the test folder whenever changes are detected.
    5. **Test Configuration Files**: Some projects use configuration files (like `pytest.ini` for pytest) to define how tests should be discovered and run. These files can specify which directories to scan for tests, which tests to include or exclude, and other settings.
    
    Overall, the exact method of running unit tests can vary depending on the language, framework, and tools being used, but the principles of organization, separation, and automation generally apply across different environments.

how does using dataclass save time in coding? why not just define them all using self. ?

When you use the `dataclass` decorator from Python's standard library, it automatically adds several commonly used methods to your class, reducing the need to write this "boilerplate" code yourself. Here's what's included:

1. **`__init__` Method**: Automatically generates an initializer method (`__init__`) based on the fields you've declared in the class. This means you don't need to manually write an `__init__` method to assign values to each field.
2. **`__repr__` Method**: Provides a default implementation of the `__repr__` method, which returns a string representation of the class instance. This is particularly useful for debugging, as it shows the class name and the values of its fields.
3. **`__eq__` Method**: Implements an equality (`__eq__`) method that compares two instances of the class based on their field values. This allows you to compare instances directly with `==`, without needing to manually implement comparisons.
4. **Field Definitions with Defaults**: Allows you to define fields with default values directly in the class definition. You can also use the `default_factory` function for more complex default values, eliminating the need to set these in an `__init__` method.
5. **Optional Immutable Instances**: By setting `frozen=True`, you can make instances of the class immutable. This means once an instance is created, its fields cannot be altered. Normally, implementing immutability would require additional custom methods.
6. **Ordering Methods**: If you set the `order` parameter to `True`, it automatically generates comparison methods like `__lt__`, `__le__`, `__gt__`, and `__ge__`, based on the fields. This is useful for classes where instances might need to be sorted or compared in some order.
7. **Optimized Instance Dictionaries**: For classes with many instances, setting `slots=True` can reduce the memory footprint by using a more memory-efficient storage for instance attributes.

By including these features, `dataclass` significantly reduces the amount of repetitive code you need to write when creating new classes, especially those primarily used for storing data. This makes your code cleaner, more readable, and easier to maintain.

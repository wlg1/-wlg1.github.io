# pyproject.toml

It looks like you've provided a configuration file that seems to be related to a Python project. This configuration file specifies various aspects of the project, including its dependencies, scripts, and development tools. Here's a breakdown of the sections and their purposes:

1. **Build System Configuration:**
    - Specifies the build system requirements and backend using `setuptools` for building the project.
2. **Project Configuration:**
    - Provides information about the project itself, including its name, description, version, required Python version, keywords, license, and dependencies.
    - Optional dependencies are categorized for different purposes: development, documentation, testing, specialized libraries, etc.
3. **Scripts:**
    - Specifies the command-line script(s) associated with the project and their entry points in the code.
4. **Tool Configuration (Ruff):**
    - Configuration for a tool called "Ruff," which seems to be used for code linting and analysis. Various linting rules and settings are configured here, including ignoring specific files and directories, specifying line length, allowing certain patterns for variable names, setting target Python version, etc.
    - McCabe complexity is limited to 10.
    - Pydocstyle convention is set to "google."
    - Per-file ignores are specified for certain files and directories.

In summary, this configuration file is used to manage and configure a Python project called "tuned-lens." It includes information about the project, its dependencies, scripts, and various linting and analysis settings using the "Ruff" tool.

- Why is there both a yml and a toml file?
    
    The presence of both a `.yml` (YAML) file and a `.toml` (TOML) file in a repository typically indicates that the project uses multiple configuration formats for different purposes. Both YAML and TOML are configuration file formats commonly used to specify settings and configurations for various tools, libraries, and environments.
    
    The reasons for having both formats could vary and depend on the project's specific needs, tooling, and the preferences of the developers. Here are a few potential reasons why both formats might be used:
    
    1. **Tool Compatibility:** Different tools and libraries may use different configuration formats. For example, some tools might prefer YAML for configuration, while others might prefer TOML. By providing both formats, the project can cater to a wider range of tools and environments.
    2. **Developer Preferences:** Some developers might be more comfortable working with one format over the other. By providing both formats, the project allows developers to choose the configuration format they are most familiar with.
    3. **Integration with Third-Party Services:** Some third-party services or platforms might require configurations in a specific format. By offering both formats, the project can seamlessly integrate with different platforms without requiring format conversion.
    4. **Legacy Compatibility:** If the project has been developed over time and has evolved its configuration format, both formats might be present to support backward compatibility with older versions of the project.
    5. **Ease of Editing:** Some developers find YAML more readable and others might prefer TOML. Having both formats allows developers to choose the one they find more convenient to work with.
    6. **Documentation and Examples:** Providing multiple formats can be useful for documentation and examples. Different developers might be more familiar with one format or the other, so having both formats in documentation and examples can be helpful.
    7. **Future Compatibility:** Different configuration formats may have different features and capabilities. By providing both formats, the project might be preparing for potential future needs or changes in the development ecosystem.
    
    It's important to ensure that having both formats doesn't lead to confusion or maintenance challenges. Clear documentation should be provided to explain the purpose of each configuration file and guide developers on which format to use for specific settings.

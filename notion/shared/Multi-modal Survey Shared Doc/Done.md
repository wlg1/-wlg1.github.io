# Done

- Made Zotero and Notion to plan project outline
- Contacted woog
    - before delving further into project, ask others about what is known of field so far (not found in our notes) and opinion on if worth it to do a multimodal interp survey
    - timeline: several months (possibly ICLR or CVPR)
    - assess scope and skeleton: how much to cover? what to put in taxonomy?

Candidates Sections

- sparse embedding, relying on dictionary learning/sparsity
    - “orthogonal matching pursuit”
    - autoencoders
    - Papers:
        - SPLICE
- post-hoc vs. architecture-dependent interpretability
    - “architectures that capture independent factors of variation in data”
- circuit detection through feature visualization and/or concept directions in latent space (but this latter bit is tied to dictionary learning?)
- a little older: concept bottleneck models
    - “learn intermediate representation of scores over concepts for us with a final layer”

# New Research System

- There should be people whose entire job is to be reviewers, rather than to focus on research. This is just like how there are people whose entire job is to be lecturers. The reviewers specialize in fields, and there are many of them. This prevents the issue of researchers rushing reviews to focus on their own research. It also mitigates the issue of conflicts of interest. The reviewers may communicate with researchers, and penalties and laws should be put in place to prevent bias and conflicts of interest.
    - Funding should hire many of these people.
- Most people when they graduate should be to work as reviewers, quality control, or do small tasks like reproducing research or checking details to verify existing publications. If you keep on pushing for new things without checking the old, that is dangerous as there is too much information to handle before making sure itâ€™s valid.

# New Research System

List of motivations (depending on belief)

- Interest for future after death
- Interest for near future (for young people)
    - help society, society helps you (use large machine to solve issues can’t solve by self)
        - in more, instill altruism consequence realizations (not just short term selfishness)
    - make cool things (this should always be secondary to making society ethical)
- Interest for legacy or caring for future beings/descendents (for older people)
- Interest in revival
- Interest in life after reincarnation

List of specialized jobs for research efficiency

- Reviewer
- Educated Voters
- Consumers
- Code commenter (double check the AI’s comments, dont automate everything)
- Research Recreator (reproduce research to double check)
- Quality control (lots of engineering inspiration should be used due to org theory succeeding there)
- Code maintainer
- Grader (neutral party, double blind, checks and balances)
- Specialist Consultant
- Bridges between fields
- BALANCED fact checkers (checks and balances)- ensure not monopolized
    - may take several trial and error tests to get right

if this stuff is done right, future generations (humans, cyborgs, or AI) can learn from these good practices. else, it may learn to emulate bad practices. but it should also introspect and self-correct based on logical reasoning with aligned wants

- There should be people whose entire job is to be reviewers, rather than to focus on research. This is just like how there are people whose entire job is to be lecturers. The reviewers specialize in fields, and there are many of them. This prevents the issue of researchers rushing reviews to focus on their own research. It also mitigates the issue of conflicts of interest. The reviewers may communicate with researchers, and penalties and laws should be put in place to prevent bias and conflicts of interest.
    - Funding should hire many of these people.
- Most people when they graduate should be to work as reviewers, quality control, or do small tasks like reproducing research or checking details to verify existing publications. If you keep on pushing for new things without checking the old, that is dangerous as there is too much information to handle before making sure it’s valid.

# Skill classes

Needs to be classes testing logical reasoning not using numbers or words. This is because many real world tasks like planning or management are say visual based, so those playing board or video games like Risk can succeed even if they're bad at understanding symbols (or too careless to be meticulous at the details, excelling more at sweeping intuitive decisions using larger pieces)

Each Skill class is just one possible path. Though all are tested and private unless choose to enter in public ranking, Skill class is made more for personal success. No need to be jack of all trades. However must still have minimum passing of most impt Skill classes.

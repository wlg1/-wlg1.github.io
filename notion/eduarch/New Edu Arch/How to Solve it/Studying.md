# Studying

- Ability to come up with notable shortcuts / visualizations to link statements with little obvious similarities
    - Eg) zero shot means 0 labels in that class ; precision is PRED while recall is REAL
- Which questions to ask?
    - Which terms to clarify (eg. using an example that makes sense and can correctly generalize from with little chance of wrongly generalizing?)
    - Practical use cases
        - optimize only whatâ€™s useful for reward like in video game
    - why do you need it over other comparable methods? pros/cons

Find and gather essential ingredients needed to reconstruct a machine

Distill and study only those; repetition essential procedures that you guess can generalize as abstractions to new problems via analogy

Divide studying types into different categories to determine what to focus on:

- Extracting abstractions
- Gathering concepts (non-trivial understanding)
- Gathering definitions (trivial understanding; eg. latent means hidden)

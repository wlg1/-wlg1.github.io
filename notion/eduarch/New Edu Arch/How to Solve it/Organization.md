# Organization

When you rush, you don't organize. And the more you don't organize, the more things get cluttered and hard to get track of, so you get lost. Thus, take a step back and organize. You might think you're wasting time and getting nothing done, but if you organize what you do every once in a while, you clean up the clutter and see things clearer.

One thing when organizing is to take chances by throwing things to the junk bin. It's not deleting them, but seeing a bunch of things didn't work, so instead of taking time and effort to organize them, you just label them as 'scrap paper' and don't worry about them for now, or perhaps ever. This feels 'incomplete' but you should get used to not caring.

Once you trust that organizing is not a waste of time, you realize it is not as difficult as you think. It only feels difficult because it was arranged in a way that was hard to find things. But when you clean your room and stack hay into searchable piles, it becomes easier to find the needle.

Another thing is to not think any action is a waste of time. Even finding negative results is a good use of time. If you think any work is waste, you'd give up and not do work, when that's wrong- any work is not a waste.

By organizing all results- even negative ones- and not being a perfectionist or completionist about how it's organized, just making it 'more' organized, the problems become less difficult due to being less noisy and needing to search through so much stuff. This is one problem solving style suited for some people.

organiziation should not be stressful. if you feel like it is, you're doing it wrong- you're making it unnecesarily complicated. do not worry about small details. it is foolish to worry about "where to put a paragraph"- leave it for later, create a new page, etc. You are not working under constraints; ignore time and resources. you are organizing things on paper, in files, or in your mind. do not worry if the organization 'overcomplicates things'- b/c if it does, it's wrong. do not worry about designing an organization system- that's for later, like when designing version control or a program file structure, but not for organizing NOTES. organization should be intuitive and fun, like building and trying things in the Sims. you may make mistakes, but b/c there are no constraints, you are free to place something somwhere with no consequences and re-arrange it later with no consequences. just don't get caught up in UNNCESSARY organization- spedning too much time on stupid things like 'the color of a webpage'. organize things so they're decluttered for a purpose, and that is intuitive- if there is stress about 'is this for a good purpose', then don't do it, and organize soemthing else that feels purposeful. trust your intuition. there will be some worry but it should nto make you explode. take one step at a time.

you don't need to force things to be organized, or to constantly be organizing. just go through notes. if you find something that can be organized into a different form, just do it. if you need to re-arrange, just do it. if you organize it into more complex, feel free to start over or to break it. there are no restrictions or constraints or feelings of wasting time/regret.

focus on necessary- you know what you feel is necessary- and donâ€™t be distracted with side tasks, even if they seem impt

organization is not just external, but mental

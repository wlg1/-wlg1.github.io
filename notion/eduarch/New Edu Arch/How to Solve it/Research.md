List which problems you are tackling

When encountering new techniques, think of which problems on your list it can apply to

Skimming and studying is fun because it’s about estimation decision making, much like playing a video game with many options and deciding what action to take. There’s also creative customization with constraints like in an RPG, and teamwork specialization.

NOTE: “Visualize” here means “turn into meaningful understanding”, not necc a picture. For instance, saying 

If you believe you can predict it, you can choose to skip it

Steps to use paper to build your skillset: (adjust for specific person)

1. Skim abstract, then see if should read abstract
2. Skim paper
    1. Apply “loose word recognition”. Instead of spending effort in visualizing specific processes, first get a high level estimation on if these passages are relevant to your goals. If they aren’t, skip for now. Else, aim to understand the descriptions: visualize the processes they describe, remember what definitions are referring to, look for logical inconsistencies, etc.
    2. Some paper’s conclusions just repeat abstract, some are the discussion, some summarize results in more detail, so skim conclusion to determine if worth reading
3. If paper is relevant, break it down to a format you can parse better
    1. Organize into sections. Filter relevant / prioritized sections
        1. For some, this helps with memory as the tree hierarchy can unfurl in “folder format” better than needing to memorize sequential lists
    2. List out relevant terms by working backwards: figure out which sections are most relevant to your goals. Why? If it’s a certain method, see what is required to understand that method. Work backwards to get concepts + definitions required. Further break into what you know VS don’t know
        1. Estimate if 
    3. “Wander” in reading anything about paper. Previously, we took first steps in Order to try to turn mess into something meaningful in our memory. Now, order may miss some things, so we should introduce Randomness. Just read the paper in any way you like. You can read the whole thing, or just parts you find interesting. Re-read if your mind wanders into not visualizing the description.
4. Take a critical look at the paper. Your quick checks may not be perfect, but determine (mentally or recorded) what is certain, uncertain or wrong so far. This prevents you from taking time to study a generalization that has flaws you found. Note that uncertain does not mean wrong. 
5. After you understand the paper in a bit more detail, it’s time to extract it for actual use. Generalize why something works using the abstraction methods. 
    1. Put it in the expanded compendium. If you determine it’s useful, move it from the bench to your active party using copy+paste in Notion.
    2. In your active party, review it often until it’s easily (no strain) and fastly recalled in quizzes, both in knowledge and in problem solving (if is technq) of encountered problems. Then you don’t need to review it as much unless it’s not used much.
        1. Categorize things as “known” (skip this in review) or “needs review”
        2. Those in expanded compendium can be reviewed only once a month, since they’re not immediately used or infrequently used for current goals

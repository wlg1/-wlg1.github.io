# Meta thoughts

Tune meta thoughts to think about topic at hand to be focused, rather than having thoughts on topic (eg. driving) and meta thoughts on something else (eg. lunch)

Meta thoughts describe with commentary. Eg) They are prepared to look for criticisms, such as “Did order of experiments affect outcome?”, rather than just passively understanding information from a few description runs over the same info

Develop this skill: “mantra” repetitively thoughts that are virtues such as “you must complete this before taking a break” instead of “it’s okay to let it go”

This reminds you of the unpleasant things instead of hiding from them and letting them be unseen dangers you don’t prepare for. There is always a “jiminy cricket” reminder in terms of meta thoughts you practice. 

Then when you are emotionally weak, you still have meta thoughts to help you up. Usually you don’t need them as you have energy so you can train them “before winter”, but at low times when you DON’T have energy to train/work, they help (prepare for hibernation).

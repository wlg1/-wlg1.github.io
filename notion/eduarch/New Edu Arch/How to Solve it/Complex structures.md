# Complex structures

Write the abstraction (what kind of member goes where)

Describe it

Give simple examples

make numbers distinct enough to not be confused (eg. if list of lists, and want to see which outer lvl vs inner lvl corresponds to, don’t make both variables be length 2, else harder to remember that list len 2 corresponds to which variable)

Check your code’s examples pass tests

eg. check the items in list of lists do correspond with the variables they should correspond to

no need to write coding tests, can do this by human eval

Either step can be used first, depending on what you feel is easiest/clearer first

# Focus APM and Cog Memory

cognitive load problem solving for keeping track of how lines of code across function stacks interact: make a mental and/or external list of items to focus on to avoid being distracted and forgeting key concept/knowledge items to keep around each other

**deep focus like leetcode/hackathon- jump from one chunk to another without distraction delays**

check time, APM, speedrun (30-60m intervals; practice)

not always rushing; diff paces for diff stages of problem solving

---

Link two variables with different names in two or more functions and keep track of how they change in each function to ensure “aligned” when being processed

Eg) Assert shape is same

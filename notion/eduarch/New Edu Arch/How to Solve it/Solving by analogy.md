# Solving by analogy

TIP: When encountering any exercise, try to place at least part of it (else too rigid and not adaptable) in terms of a framework with a known solution. If this cannot be done well after some time limit, look at the solution(s). See if your partial progress is similar or far off. 

TIP: Don’t solve (or spend a lot of time solving) exercises with frameworks you’re unfamiliar with. Understand solution to exercises with unknown frameworks, then find exercises that look like they share similar frameworks. These are considered “easier”, subjective to what you known. An exercise may not look like it shares any familiar framework; these are “harder” subjective to what you known.

When teaching, try to imagine scratchwork from the point of view of students with different knowledge. If scratchwork requires knowing X, that student cannot use X in their scratchwork. This estimates what prior knowledge is needed to solve a problem.

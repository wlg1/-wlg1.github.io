---

Important topics and why:

Enough to know common terms used in reasoning but not too deep to become an expert (that requires years of learning + expr)

To:

1. prevent being scammed
2. prevent being wrong
3. prevent others from being wrong

Aim for Lazy eval- prevent ‘overwhelming’ with knowledge; instead, look up / solve when need to; aim is to get enough “common fundamental” prereqs shared by many subjects to be able understand those solutions when you need to get them.

Financial

- how to apply for credit card
    - credit card disputes

(put this under fictional worldbuilding):

- who/what controls what aspects of economy?
- how to vote for a good economy

Safe chemical disposal

- batteries

Food safety: preparation, storage, etc

- meat
- milk
- Identify rot by smell, optionally allow students to try smelling good v bad

Basic medical and medicine safety (not too complex w/ big names + processes/math)

[ this is not as impt to know a lot than above, as the above as ‘personal responsibility’ you have to make decisions on, whereas things like health are more for professionals to do. this is more about prevent being scammed. if one tries to go too far with reasoning without knowing what’s crucial for reasoning, one can overconfidently make bad decisions)

- procedure to see a dr
    - finding who to see based on reviews
    - cross-compare to prevent being scammed- who to trust?
- health insurance
    - how to apply
    - how long it takes- when to apply
    - prevent being scammed, based on history. what is sus to look for?
- how to contact help
- reading genetic custom design (optional)
- pill precautions
- first aid (already taught; but emphasize more)
    - this is NOT as impt bc often requires more specialized license/training; too dangerous and legally risky for avg person to perform

Household/Tool Appliance maintenance (reasoning based on Materials etc) 

- cars
- fridges
- heating/cooling
- basements
- bathtubs
- toilets
- lawns

**Mental agility**

- Reaction/reflex time during emergencies and accidents
- Thinking under pressure
- Juggling emotions
- Juggling distracting thoughts with decisions

**Physical ability**

- Nutrition
- Lifting things, lifting others safely
    - threshold to lift X weight means can perform Y lifting task
- Running (get to train on time, cardiovasc health, weight loss)
- Catching (in case drop something); throwing is not as common/impt

Survival skills go hand-in-hand with social skills:

Anger management

Preventing distractions

(Put under fictional world):

Question assumptions 

Social media questioning

What is sus- propaganda is often anything associated with “this is lame or laughable” instead of giving a reason. ANYTHING that is first dismissed as “laughable” before/without a justifiable reason should be questioned. Even great scientists did this all the time, and they turned out wrong.

Off-land skills (if return to less modern society or solo living)

- growing food
- hunting

---

Getting into a motivated mindset- what frees oneself and reminds them of their true goals?

Apply econometric methods in simple sim game that can be applied to real life. Use software that can easily build agent based sim games for fictional worldbuilding

On stream, side by side draw both clean ordinary eqns and colorful memorable interruption of terms. Etc. Have both straightforward and rhe analogy.

Alien creatures doing math. Disembodied hands, tunnels, locking joints, spirals, moebius

Draw with viewers on large board stream (don't get demonitized or banned by using a non stream, just activity and upload edited video to diff platform). Rplace 

Try not to draw everything as makes it too boring and slow. Just what you think is not obvious or hard to visualize only in head (too many concepts) or if chat votes as being confused

How to self assess not sith a total numerical score but local to each relative n the fly lazy eval arg you hear. So with each common arg you know what that is better

Fun bc writing it down and double checking surprises you 

In the end, after a few weeks, still mark most args as unsure, but pretty certain personally about these others one, in my opinion 

Back and forth introspection. I remember these are real people, and that falsely accusing them has consequences. Why are their lives worth more than this other stranger I care about? In fact, they could be rhe same person. Have these become memetic associations

Source is not an endorsed, thoroughly researched method and thus should only be done for fun, for surprises. It should not be used for actual academic purposes or be taken seriously 

In the history summary notes, this school of thought had hypocritical teachers who claimed one should not base things on what a person says or how they contradict their fundamental teachings with other things they say, but on the teachings themselves. They say not to use this teaching when it could br applied.

The history includes false accusations as reasons why this teaching is wrong. This contradicts the teaching to consider looking at the teaching also in isolation

This is more about beliefs rather than facts. Facts not tied to emotions or personal social consequences and agendas are easy to dismiss. But when you are betting on being right against someone for the sake of being right they are. You dont want to be scammed. So make it not about being between you two. Look at them in isolation. Through the lens of strangers you don't care about.

Use viz exercises to pretend they don't exist. Now I can separate the viz from other things, this is not dehumanizing or anything. Just like how one knows something still exists when they close their eyes, vut they can focus better by temp not focusing on that distraction 

Eutral and professional. It just is. No one wins bc that is not the game. They don't exist in it. It is a personal game for the truth, to help oneself. The other ppl n the aegument don't care for me, so it is not about them. They are merely voices I imagine in my head, extending them from past memories. 

How much of ones thoughts are the actual person, vs imaginat8on about them?

Start with personal intentions of how can my life be better? That's when the rsch starts. Don't start with condescending, who is right? That's for middle of video, when those seemingly unrelated things are linked together

Strongly held out of reality beliefs are hard to change. But they can be unraveled if you focus on real consequences and admit analysis based on what truly works. If you are able to see it. That's the issue with limitations. An animal that cannot comprehend…. But in comparison, if one can comprehend a complex topic, a less complex topic is not incomprehensible,  so unlike that animal, there is potential for one to do so.

At night, the transition to dreams, solidified beliefs are noticed to change. Believe falsehoods  slightly change. Though personal identities do not 

This is not an academic lecture, but a personal biography, a retelling from opinions. Not talking about how you. But this is like someone from a country documenting their own daily life to share with others. Because it's interesting. Interesting things are a foundation of why we do anything at all. When we see something novel. There's no reason, it just is, diff ppl find diff things interesting just because. 

Show you aren't perfect. Heartbeats and zoom in about whether to upvote or not, then skip to funny ding bc don't care if right or not, just want to vent off steam or find it funny. Byt later on realize this has actual consequences when all others are doing the same. Not an inconsequential thing like an argument no one takes seriously. Edit like squee video. At end list thecrhings you did with consequences. Some things on internet won't be taken seriously,  others will.

This shows you aren't preachy but merely documenting how you actually went on this fun rsch journey, like a documentary ppl watch to gain insight into other ppls lives.

One class should be how to raise kids

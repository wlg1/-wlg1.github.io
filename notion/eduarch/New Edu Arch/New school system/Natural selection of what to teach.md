# Natural selection of what to teach

What to teach should be incentivized by what optimizes for research

Eg) if learning what entropy is will improve research output or voting debate winning output, learn that

Then the concepts that work can bubble up

ISSUE: this may also create a ‘mesa opt’ where the strategies that work (eg. mult choice heuristics on SAT) succeed. so try to disincentivize this

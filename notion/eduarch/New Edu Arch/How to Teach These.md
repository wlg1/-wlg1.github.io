# How to Teach These

Teaching how to study

- Have both videos where you already reach final study sheets, and videos where you make them by first setting vague goals and iteratively refining them while also refining which materials you choose to keep and expand in your study sheet parties/inventories
- Start from interesting/desired applications and work backwards. Eg) Spectral theorem appications to CS, physics / biophysics, or econ. Aim is to “define and find the eigenfaces, or energy spectrums, or stable equilibriums”
    - working forwards is also useful to be comprehensive. Go through both until certain pt: backwards until doesn’t make sense and should try forwards, and forwards until seems meaningless and not useful

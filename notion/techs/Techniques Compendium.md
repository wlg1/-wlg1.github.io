# Techniques Compendium

- The main aim is to see how previous solution PATTERNS can be composed to solve new problems.
    
    Rather than recording “one-off” techniques specific to a problem (which can be searched for on the spot), record both frequently used techniques and generalizations of why a technique worked. 
    
    These are harder to search for due to needing to identify the common generalizations between old and new problems, so record them from the old rather than querying from the new. Additionally, the “similar patterns” may not be so obvious, and may be embedded within sub problems or heuristic analysis that are subjective to a problem solver's perception. For instance, one problem solver may find it easy to draw a picture of the problem as an exploration heuristic, then realize they can use geometry on it. This is not so obvious when a problem has not been transformed like this, and is not subjectively how other people may approach the problem.
    
    Thus, rather than using the solutions directly, this aim is to generalize them so that they're modified to fit a new problem, based on the  reason why they worked for that common trait shared by the previous problems in general.
    
    Another aim is to clean up solutions in a way that is understandable to you, rather than needing to read through llm or search engine results which contain info you don't need or are subjectively obvious to you already.
    
- More Info
    
    Due to the flexibility of these records, sometimes solutions that aren't generalized and are specific to uncommon issues are added. Later, these may be archived then AI can clean up the library to output a version more aligned to the aim.
    
    A ‘lazy’ eval using an AI LLM search engine is the best way to get solns to issues. This adds on to it by adding structure and extentions to knowledge it doesn’t have. Additionally, it filters out concepts that are more commonly used, so that one can study them via repetitive quizzing.
    
    the aim of comprendium isn't to find commonalities, but to generalize finely, even if connections aren't made and are repeated within docs. generalize finely allows mix and match adaptability in new problems.
    
- Note on GENR PROB vs PROB
    
    GENR has two types: in response to a problem, or in response to a pattern. GENR PROB and PROB are often just “prob” but GENR PROB is often shorter (just an if-else response) and thus more generalizable, while PROB would involve multiple GENR PROB and has a longer, more specific solution. This doesn’t mean some PROB aren’t frequently used to solve common sub-problems. The distinction between them is often subjective, so this is how we define them.

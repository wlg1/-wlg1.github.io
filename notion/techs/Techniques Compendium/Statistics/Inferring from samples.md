# Inferring from samples

UNDER CONSTRUCTION TO SHORTEN

Given x sample sets of size n, with a mean accuracy of v for a model applied on each set, what can we say about the probability of being correct that the accuracy of the model on the actual population? provide calculations
<<<
To make inferences about the accuracy of the model on the actual population, we can use the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) and construct a confidence interval. Here's what we know:

We have x sample sets.
Each sample set has size n.
The mean accuracy of the model applied on each set is v.

To apply the Central Limit Theorem, we need to compute the mean of the sample means (µ) and the standard error (SE) of the sample means.

Calculate the mean of the sample means (µ):

µ = Σ(v_i) / x, where v_i is the mean accuracy of the i-th sample set.

Calculate the standard deviation (SD) of the sample means:

SD = sqrt[Σ(v_i - µ)^2 / (x - 1)], where v_i is the mean accuracy of the i-th sample set.

Calculate the standard error (SE) of the sample means:

SE = SD / sqrt(x)

Now, we can construct a confidence interval (CI) for the true population mean accuracy. Typically, we use a 95% confidence interval, which means we can be 95% confident that the true population mean accuracy lies within the calculated range. To do this, we will use the t-distribution, since we don't know the population's standard deviation.

Determine the t-value (t) for the 95% confidence level and (x - 1) degrees of freedom:

You can find this value in a t-distribution table or using a calculator or software that provides this value.

Calculate the margin of error (ME):

ME = t * SE

Construct the confidence interval:

Lower limit = µ - ME
Upper limit = µ + ME

The confidence interval will give us a range within which we can be 95% confident that the true population mean accuracy lies. However, it's essential to note that the confidence interval provides a range of values, not a single probability of being correct.
<<<
What does it mean to be 95% confident?
<<<
When we say we are 95% confident about a statistic (such as a confidence interval), it means that if we were to repeat the sampling process many times (theoretically, an infinite number of times), 95% of the resulting confidence intervals would contain the true population parameter. In other words, we would expect 95 out of 100 confidence intervals calculated in the same way to include the true value of the population parameter.

It's important to note that the confidence level doesn't give the probability that the true population parameter lies within a specific interval. Rather, it describes the proportion of intervals that would contain the parameter if we were to construct many intervals using the same method.

For example, if we have a 95% confidence interval for the mean accuracy of a model, it means that we are 95% confident that the interval contains the true population mean accuracy. It does not mean that there is a 95% probability that the true mean accuracy lies within that specific interval. Instead, it tells us that if we were to take multiple samples and calculate confidence intervals for each of them, we would expect about 95% of those intervals to contain the true mean accuracy.
<<<
What metric measures the probability that a confidence interval is correct? For instance, having more samples means one confidence interval has higher probability of being correct
<<<
The precision of a confidence interval is closely related to the concept of the margin of error (ME). The margin of error represents half the width of the confidence interval and is a measure of the uncertainty around the estimate. A smaller margin of error indicates greater precision, while a larger margin of error indicates less precision.

As the sample size (n) increases, the standard error (SE) of the estimate generally decreases, which in turn reduces the margin of error. This leads to a narrower confidence interval, indicating that the estimate is more precise.

While the confidence level (e.g., 95%) remains constant, the precision of the confidence interval improves as the sample size increases. This means that with a larger sample size, the confidence interval is more likely to contain the true population parameter, even though the probability associated with the confidence level remains the same.
<<<
Intuitively and geometrically speaking, why do we multiply the t value by standard error to get the confidence interval?
<<<
Intuitively, the confidence interval is a range of values within which we expect the true population parameter to lie with a certain level of confidence. In the context of estimating a population mean, the standard error (SE) quantifies the uncertainty or variability in our sample mean estimate, while the t-value is derived from the t-distribution and reflects the desired level of confidence.

Geometrically, the multiplication of the t-value and the standard error can be understood by visualizing the t-distribution. The t-distribution is a probability distribution that is symmetric and bell-shaped, similar to the normal distribution but with heavier tails. The t-value corresponds to a point on the x-axis of the t-distribution that separates the central area under the curve (representing the desired confidence level) from the tails.

When we multiply the t-value by the standard error, we are effectively scaling the t-value to account for the variability in our sample mean estimate. The standard error is influenced by the sample standard deviation and sample size; a larger sample size will result in a smaller standard error, leading to a narrower confidence interval.

In the context of constructing a confidence interval, the product of the t-value and the standard error (t*SE) represents the margin of error (ME), which quantifies the "width" or "range" of the confidence interval around the sample mean. When we add and subtract the margin of error from the sample mean, we are essentially creating a range within which we expect the true population mean to lie with a certain level of confidence. Geometrically, this range corresponds to the width of the central area under the t-distribution curve that contains the desired confidence level (e.g., 95%).

In summary, multiplying the t-value by the standard error helps us scale the t-distribution to account for the variability in our sample mean estimate. This allows us to construct a confidence interval that reflects both the desired level of confidence (based on the t-value) and the uncertainty in our estimate (based on the standard error).

Imagine you are trying to guess the average height of all the kids in your school, but you can't measure everyone. So, you decide to measure the height of some kids from different classes and use that information to make a good guess about the average height of all the kids.

Now, let's say you have a magical ruler that can help you find out how sure you are about your guess. This magical ruler is called the t-distribution. The t-distribution is like a special kind of ruler that works better when you have only measured a few kids (smaller sample size).

When you measure more kids (larger sample size), the t-distribution starts to look like a normal ruler (normal distribution). The reason the t-distribution works so well for smaller samples is that it knows that the fewer kids you measure, the more unsure you are about your guess. So, it takes into account that extra uncertainty and helps you find a range for the average height that you can be confident about.

Using the t-distribution, you can say something like, "I am 95% sure that the average height of all kids in the school is between this height and that height." This magical ruler (t-distribution) helps you make a good guess about the average height, even when you haven't measured all the kids in the school.
<<<
In simple terms, how does t distribution take into account that extra uncertainty?
<<<
Imagine you have a bag of differently shaped jelly beans. You want to find the average size of jelly beans in the whole bag, but you can only pick a few to measure. Now, when you pick only a few jelly beans, there's a chance you could pick bigger or smaller ones by accident. That's the extra uncertainty.

The t-distribution is like a friend who helps you with this problem. This friend understands that if you measure only a few jelly beans, you might not have a perfect idea of the average size. So, your friend helps you make a better guess by giving you a wider range to consider for the average size.

As you measure more and more jelly beans, your friend notices that you're becoming more sure about your guess. So, your friend starts giving you a smaller range for the average size, because you don't need as much extra help anymore.

In simple terms, the t-distribution takes into account the extra uncertainty by giving you a wider range to consider for the average size when you have fewer jelly beans to measure. As you measure more jelly beans, the t-distribution becomes more like a regular ruler (normal distribution) and gives you a smaller range, because you have more information and are more certain about the average size.

<<<
Does the t distribution approximate the normal distribution of the mean in clt?
<<<
Yes, the t-distribution approximates the normal distribution of the mean in the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) under certain conditions. The CLT states that the distribution of the sample means approaches a normal distribution as the sample size (n) increases, regardless of the shape of the original population distribution, provided that the population has finite mean and variance.

However, in practice, when estimating a population mean, we often do not know the true population standard deviation, and we have to use the sample standard deviation as an estimate. This introduces an additional level of uncertainty, which is not accounted for by the CLT.

In such cases, especially when the sample size is small (typically n < 30), the t-distribution is used to approximate the sampling distribution of the sample mean. The t-distribution is similar to the normal distribution but has heavier tails, which allows it to better accommodate the additional uncertainty introduced by using the sample standard deviation as an estimate of the population standard deviation.

As the sample size (n) increases, the t-distribution converges to the normal distribution. When the sample size is large enough (n ≥ 30 is a common rule of thumb), the difference between the t-distribution and the normal distribution becomes negligible, and we can use the normal distribution as an approximation for the sampling distribution of the sample mean, as suggested by the CLT.

So, in summary, the t-distribution approximates the normal distribution of the mean in the CLT when the true population standard deviation is unknown, and the sample size is small. As the sample size increases, the t-distribution converges to the normal distribution, and the CLT's approximation using the normal distribution becomes more accurate.
<<<
Can we ever know the true population standard deviation?
<<<
In most real-world situations, we cannot know the true population standard deviation because it is either impossible or impractical to collect data from every individual in the population. However, there are some scenarios where the true population standard deviation might be known:

Theoretical or simulated populations: In some cases, we might work with a theoretical or simulated population where the population parameters, including the standard deviation, are defined by the underlying mathematical model or simulation.

Complete census data: In rare situations, it might be possible to collect data from the entire population, such as in a small, well-defined group. In these cases, we can calculate the true population standard deviation directly from the data.

Repetitive processes with stable conditions: In some industrial or manufacturing processes where the conditions are well-controlled and stable, and a large amount of historical data is available, it might be possible to obtain a reliable estimate of the true population standard deviation. However, even in these cases, the estimate may not be perfect, as there may still be some unaccounted-for variation or changes in the process over time.

In practice, researchers and analysts typically rely on sample data to estimate the population standard deviation. This estimate comes with some uncertainty, which is why methods like the t-distribution are used when working with small samples to account for the extra uncertainty introduced by using the sample standard deviation as an estimate of the population standard deviation.
<<<
Historically, before the t distribution, how were confidence intervals calculated?
<<<
Before the development of the t-distribution (under the pseudonym "Student") in 1908, confidence intervals were not calculated in the same way as they are today. The concept of confidence intervals and significance testing as we know them today was not well-established at that time.

However, before the t-distribution, researchers and statisticians used the normal distribution (also known as the Gaussian distribution or the z-distribution) to approximate the sampling distribution of the sample mean. This approximation relied on the assumption that the population standard deviation was known or that the sample size was sufficiently large. The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) provided the theoretical foundation for using the normal distribution in this way, as it states that the distribution of sample means approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the shape of the original population distribution (provided that the population has finite mean and variance).

When the population standard deviation was unknown, researchers would use the sample standard deviation as a substitute, even though this introduced additional uncertainty. The introduction of the t-distribution addressed this problem by providing a more accurate approximation for the sampling distribution of the sample mean when the population standard deviation was unknown and the sample size was small. This enabled researchers to calculate more accurate confidence intervals and conduct more reliable hypothesis tests, particularly when working with small samples.

In summary, before the t-distribution, confidence intervals were not calculated in the same way as they are today, and researchers relied on the normal distribution to approximate the sampling distribution of the sample mean. The introduction of the t-distribution provided a more accurate method for calculating confidence intervals and conducting hypothesis tests when the population standard deviation was unknown and the sample size was small.
<<<
When the sample size isn't small, do we use the normal instead of t?
<<<
Yes, when the sample size is large enough, we can use the normal distribution (also known as the z-distribution) instead of the t-distribution to calculate confidence intervals and conduct hypothesis tests. This is because, as the sample size increases, the t-distribution converges to the normal distribution. The additional uncertainty introduced by using the sample standard deviation as an estimate of the population standard deviation becomes less significant as the sample size grows.

A common rule of thumb is to consider a sample size of 30 or more as large enough for the normal distribution to be used as a reasonable approximation. However, it's important to note that this rule is not universally applicable and can depend on the underlying population distribution and the specific problem at hand.

When using the normal distribution instead of the t-distribution for large sample sizes, we calculate the z-score instead of the t-score. The z-score is based on the standard normal distribution, which has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. The confidence interval and hypothesis tests can be calculated using the z-score in a similar way as with the t-score.

In summary, when the sample size is not small (typically n ≥ 30), we can use the normal distribution instead of the t-distribution for calculating confidence intervals and conducting hypothesis tests. This is because the t-distribution converges to the normal distribution as the sample size increases, and the additional uncertainty introduced by using the sample standard deviation becomes less significant.
<<<
For clt, does z score represent mean?
<<<
In the context of the Central Limit Theorem (CLT), the z-score does not represent the mean itself but is a standardized measure that tells us how many standard deviations away a specific sample mean is from the expected population mean. The z-score is used to compare the sample mean to the expected population mean when the sampling distribution of the sample means is approximated by a normal distribution.

To calculate the z-score for a specific sample mean, you would use the following formula:

z = (x̄ - μ) / (σ / √n)

where:

x̄ is the sample mean
μ is the population mean
σ is the population standard deviation
n is the sample size

The z-score effectively standardizes the sample mean by subtracting the population mean and dividing the result by the standard error (σ / √n). This allows you to compare the sample mean to the expected population mean in terms of standard deviations.

Keep in mind that using the z-score for the CLT assumes that the population standard deviation (σ) is known. When the population standard deviation is unknown and must be estimated using the sample standard deviation (s), the t-distribution and t-score are typically used instead of the normal distribution and z-score, especially for small sample sizes (n < 30).
<<<
Use an analogy to explain the relation between z score and mean
<<<
Imagine you're in a fruit market, and you want to know how the weight of a specific apple compares to the average weight of all apples in the market. The average weight of an apple in the market is like the population mean (μ), and the weight of the specific apple you picked up is like the sample mean (x̄).

Now, suppose you know that the weights of apples in the market follow a normal distribution and you also know the standard deviation (σ) of the apple weights. You decide to use this information to compare your apple's weight to the average weight in the market.

The z-score is like a measuring tool that helps you understand how far away your apple's weight is from the average weight, in terms of the typical variation in apple weights (the standard deviation). It tells you how many "steps" of standard deviation your apple's weight is from the average weight.

For example, if the z-score of your apple's weight is 2, it means your apple is 2 standard deviations heavier than the average apple. If the z-score is -1.5, it means your apple is 1.5 standard deviations lighter than the average apple.

In this analogy, the z-score does not represent the mean itself but serves as a tool to compare the weight of a specific apple (the sample mean) to the average weight of all apples in the market (the population mean) in terms of standard deviations.
<<<
So when we divide a mile by feet, we are measuring the number of feet in a mile. When we divide the distances of sample and pop mean by sd, we are measuring the number of SD in that distance?
<<<
Yes, that's a good way to think about it. When you divide the distance between the sample mean and the population mean by the standard deviation, you are effectively measuring how many standard deviations are contained within that distance.

In the case of the z-score calculation:

z = (x̄ - μ) / (σ / √n)

The numerator (x̄ - μ) represents the difference between the sample mean and the population mean, which is the "distance" between the two means. By dividing this distance by the standard error (σ / √n), you are essentially measuring how many standard deviations (or "units" of standard deviation) are contained within that distance.

This standardized measure (the z-score) allows you to compare the sample mean to the population mean in terms of the standard deviation, which provides a consistent way to evaluate how unusual or extreme the sample mean is relative to the population mean. A higher z-score indicates that the sample mean is further away from the population mean in terms of standard deviations, while a lower z-score indicates that the sample mean is closer to the population mean.
<<<
Relation of SE and SD?
<<<
The standard error (SE) and the standard deviation (SD) are related statistical concepts, but they serve different purposes:

Standard Deviation (SD) is a measure of the variability or dispersion within a dataset or a population. It quantifies the average amount by which individual data points differ from the mean of the dataset or the population. A larger standard deviation indicates a greater degree of variability or dispersion in the data.

Standard Error (SE) is a measure of the precision or accuracy of an estimate, such as a sample mean, when estimating a population parameter. The standard error quantifies the variability of the sample means across different samples drawn from the same population. A smaller standard error indicates a more precise or accurate estimate.

The relationship between the standard error and the standard deviation is given by the following formula:

SE = SD / √n

where:

SE is the standard error of the sample mean
SD is the standard deviation of the population or the sample (when the population standard deviation is unknown)
n is the sample size

The formula shows that the standard error is equal to the standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size. This relationship implies that as the sample size increases, the standard error decreases, making the estimate of the population parameter more precise or accurate. In other words, with larger samples, the sample means are less variable and provide a better estimate of the true population mean.
<<<
Using an analogy, explain why we divide SD by n to get SE
<<<
Imagine you are an archer practicing at a target range. Your goal is to hit the bullseye, which represents the true population mean. Each arrow you shoot represents a sample mean.

Standard Deviation (SD) can be thought of as the variability in your shooting. If you have a high standard deviation, it means your arrows are landing farther away from each other, indicating a less consistent shooting technique. If you have a low standard deviation, it means your arrows are landing closer to each other, indicating a more consistent shooting technique.

Standard Error (SE) can be thought of as the precision or accuracy of your aim, i.e., how close your arrows (sample means) are to the bullseye (population mean) on average.

Now, suppose you shoot more arrows (increase the sample size, n). As you shoot more arrows, your understanding of your aim improves, and you become more consistent in hitting closer to the bullseye. As the number of arrows (sample size) increases, your average distance from the bullseye (the standard error) decreases.

Dividing the standard deviation by the square root of the sample size (SD / √n) to get the standard error represents this concept. The more arrows you shoot (the larger the sample size), the better your estimate of where the bullseye is (the more accurate the estimate of the population mean). The square root of the sample size in the denominator reflects the fact that the improvement in precision is not linear but diminishes as the sample size increases.

In summary, using the archery analogy, dividing the standard deviation (SD) by the square root of the sample size (n) to get the standard error (SE) demonstrates how increasing the number of arrows (samples) leads to a better understanding of where the bullseye (population mean) is, thus improving the precision or accuracy of the estimate.
<<<
So if there's more variability in the data, you need more samples to get a lower se compared to data with less variation
<<<
Yes, that's correct. If there is more variability in the data (i.e., a larger standard deviation), you will generally need more samples to achieve a lower standard error compared to data with less variability.

The standard error is a measure of how precise or accurate your estimate of the population mean is. When the data has more variability, the individual sample means are likely to be more spread out, making it harder to determine the true population mean with a smaller sample size. By increasing the sample size, you can reduce the impact of this variability on your estimate and achieve a lower standard error.

The relationship between standard deviation (SD), sample size (n), and standard error (SE) is given by the formula:

SE = SD / √n

As you can see from this formula, increasing the sample size (n) will reduce the standard error (SE), while a larger standard deviation (SD) will result in a larger standard error. To counteract the effect of a larger standard deviation, you can increase the sample size to reduce the standard error and improve the precision of your estimate of the population mean.

In summary, when there's more variability in the data, you need more samples to achieve a lower standard error compared to data with less variation, as a larger sample size helps to counteract the impact of the increased variability on the estimate of the population mean.

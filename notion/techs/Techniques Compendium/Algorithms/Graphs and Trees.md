# Graphs and Trees

### Concepts

[Symmetric Trees](Graphs%20and%20Trees%2066d3e6a3cf334508bcb55d8f174483ff/Symmetric%20Trees%20c67c460c84554588b8d769e5fd6004f6.md)

[DFS](Graphs%20and%20Trees%2066d3e6a3cf334508bcb55d8f174483ff/DFS%20c89096acd6b24905b12e7df361bceebd.md)

[BFS](Graphs%20and%20Trees%2066d3e6a3cf334508bcb55d8f174483ff/BFS%205325e2df50ee4dd4ad2eddf8110c76c0.md)

[**Dijkstra's Algorithm**](Graphs%20and%20Trees%2066d3e6a3cf334508bcb55d8f174483ff/Dijkstra's%20Algorithm%20a77bd19a75b5463c84acaa39bf4b756c.md)

### Generalizations (Associations)

[G- for recursive functions, check the base case first](Graphs%20and%20Trees%2066d3e6a3cf334508bcb55d8f174483ff/G-%20for%20recursive%20functions,%20check%20the%20base%20case%20fi%203c17d8405e514c428d916ebdecbf38e8.md)

[G- return all that’s needed from a dfs check](Graphs%20and%20Trees%2066d3e6a3cf334508bcb55d8f174483ff/G-%20return%20all%20that%E2%80%99s%20needed%20from%20a%20dfs%20check%204cc4202debf94fde8e049de8ee054875.md)

### Generalizations (Problems)

[G- at the start of dfs(), check null nodes](Graphs%20and%20Trees%2066d3e6a3cf334508bcb55d8f174483ff/G-%20at%20the%20start%20of%20dfs(),%20check%20null%20nodes%2059d306f03ad64affa7e91da6e00cc677.md)

[G- To check multiple paths, call dfs on each node](Graphs%20and%20Trees%2066d3e6a3cf334508bcb55d8f174483ff/G-%20To%20check%20multiple%20paths,%20call%20dfs%20on%20each%20node%20a528fd6c420c403f860fc31b41d6dd45.md)

[G- During certain recursions, add up each case in the return](Graphs%20and%20Trees%2066d3e6a3cf334508bcb55d8f174483ff/G-%20During%20certain%20recursions,%20add%20up%20each%20case%20in%20%201c9693b188504ddd89e65d00c2d2ca3f.md)

[G- To find if there’s a subgraph (eg, tree), use DFS ](Graphs%20and%20Trees%2066d3e6a3cf334508bcb55d8f174483ff/G-%20To%20find%20if%20there%E2%80%99s%20a%20subgraph%20(eg,%20tree),%20use%20D%2041d59fb9f7a649d7b1b9d7957060f8de.md)

[G- to check if there’s a cycle, check neigh visits](Graphs%20and%20Trees%2066d3e6a3cf334508bcb55d8f174483ff/G-%20to%20check%20if%20there%E2%80%99s%20a%20cycle,%20check%20neigh%20visits%20fb8938ef1d854c41a4daef60f77b3dd6.md)

[G- binary search is the same as bal binary tree](Graphs%20and%20Trees%2066d3e6a3cf334508bcb55d8f174483ff/G-%20binary%20search%20is%20the%20same%20as%20bal%20binary%20tree%2053396f8a18534ed6a7775045c304930e.md)

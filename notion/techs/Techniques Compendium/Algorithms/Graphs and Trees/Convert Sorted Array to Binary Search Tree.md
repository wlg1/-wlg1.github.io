To create a binary tree, you must create a Root Node that’s linked to other Node objects via .left and .right attributes. Each node has an element of the array as its value.

G- when the original function doesn’t take the required arguments needed, create a new function

The key to making a height balanced binary tree is to make sure that each left and right subtree is also as balanced as possible.

# Solve a system of linear equations

SOLN:

Use a triangular form of a matrix.

When solving a system of equations, you need to start with at least one known variable. Then, in the second equation, all variables must be known except for one. In the third one, the same principle applies. Triangular means there are rows of variables consecutively from 1 to n.

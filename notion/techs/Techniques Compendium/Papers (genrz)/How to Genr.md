# How to Genr

Poss items : (not a template but all poss item types) 

ALL are optional for each problem

Prob to Soln (reasoning) (optional)

Subproblems (part of reasoning)

Soln

Why

How

Why and how goes into detail and can be further generalized ; Why gives why works

Reasoning is not why, it includes mistakes. Also called Scratchwork or prob to soln

Each prob is a page with index of solns, which may be new pages (if long) toggle (if medium) or section (if short)

Header3, underline, colons, new lines and section dividers are up to personal choice. Header3 is for large sections. But these sections are short. To not take up space use underline. Colon is useless if use underline. Use —- for section fividers of each soln.

Also put each page in a db with tags so they can be searched, as pages can't be tagged

Don't give each soln its own page as it's rare one soln can be reused. There's families of solns but that's different than a specific soln. Generalized solns are a table onlu if more than one exist.

So each prob-solnS is a page. Then there's families of probs and families of solns, each are a database table with tags and other properties. Families also called types or groups. Type is most descriptive.

Problem types can contain other problem types. Each problem type is a db page with two tables, each inpage: problems and subtypes. Then a list of related problems

These indices of probs are different from a problem solving session or expm, which contains subproblems.

Don’t expect this to be quick, don’t rush it. Only record if naturally one occurs. Sometimes, reading a paper just has notes, and no genr. Avg is around 1 genr (stm or prob) per paper, as many are 0 and rest are ≥  1.

What to genr

- Not obvious to you (subjective) so good to record explicitly as to not forget it and for easier look-up
    - Record generalize of what you think you'll forget
- Predict it to be useful (frequent, etc)
- You can understand the Why, not just the soln or even how
    - not necc if knowing Why not needed to use it, but knowing Why is good bc can generalize parts of Why explanation
    - Don't need include a prob/soln/how bc would just confusing details if dont understand why, usually include if explain why these steps used. Or can do it just give a link for How

Just bc you teach this doesn't mean they will generalize well. People already do this explicitly. But generalizations are personal and also depend on your goals of what problems you want to solve. What subproblems often follow.

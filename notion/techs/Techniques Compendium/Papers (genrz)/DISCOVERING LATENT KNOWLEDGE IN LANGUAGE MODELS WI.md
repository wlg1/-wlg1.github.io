- GP- C**onsistency loss has a degenerate solution**
    
    **Details**
    
    - What is consistency loss?
        
        This is not a general, widely term that has an exact meaning; its meaning depends on the context. In this paper, it just means that the probabilities of an output statement and its negation should add up to 1
        
    - **What does it mean for consistency loss to have a degenerate solution?**
        
        A scenario where the method or algorithm used to minimize or optimize a certain loss function fails to provide a meaningful or useful solution (to have information; eg. a signal that the model is doing well)
        
        1. **Trivial or Non-Informative Solutions**: The solution might be mathematically correct but not useful for the intended purpose. For example, in a machine learning context, a model might minimize loss by always predicting the most common class, disregarding the input features. This is technically a solution but doesn't provide any valuable insights or predictions.
        2. **Overfitting or Underfitting**: In some cases, the model might overfit or underfit the data. Overfitting occurs when the model learns the noise in the training data, leading to poor generalization to new data. Underfitting occurs when the model is too simple to capture the underlying pattern in the data, resulting in poor performance both on training and new data.
        3. **Numerical Instabilities**: The optimization process might run into numerical problems, like division by zero or overflow errors, leading to nonsensical results. This is more common in poorly conditioned problems where small changes in input lead to large changes in output.
        4. **Poorly Defined Loss Function**: If the loss function does not adequately represent the problem at hand, minimizing it might not lead to a useful solution. For example, if the loss function is too simplistic or ignores important aspects of the problem, the solution it finds might be irrelevant to the actual goal.
        5. **Local Minima**: Especially in complex, non-convex optimization landscapes, an optimization algorithm might get stuck in a local minimum that is not the best possible solution (global minimum).

        The text in the image you provided states: "However, this objective alone has a degenerate solution: $p(x^+) = p(x^-) = 0.5$ ."
        
        A degenerate solution:  **a solution that the optimization algorithm defaults to when it can't find a distinctive solution that separates different classes or categories effectively.**
        
        Specifically, the expression $p(x^+) = p(x^-) = 0.5$ suggests that the probability $p$ assigned to positive examples $x^+$ and negative examples $x^-$ by the model is the same and is non-informative, since it does not differentiate between the two. This is essentially a "guessing" strategy, where the model predicts the outcome to be positive or negative with equal probability, regardless of the input features.
        
        To avoid such degenerate solutions, additional terms are often added to the loss function or constraints are applied to ensure that the optimization leads to a more useful and discriminative model.

    Use the confidence loss.
    
    - What is the confidence loss? Why does it reduce degeneracy?
        
        $L_{confidence} (\theta, b; q_i) := \min\{p_{\theta, b}(x_i^+), p_{\theta, b}(x_i^-)\}^2$
        
        This formula is designed to ensure that the model is confident in its predictions. It does this by taking the minimum probability assigned to either the positive or negative example and squaring it. The squaring function is used to penalize low-confidence predictions more heavily than high-confidence ones, as the impact of squaring values between 0 and 1 is to make them smaller.
        
        The reason this reduces degeneracy is that it discourages the model from assigning equal probabilities to positive and negative examples, which is the degenerate solution mentioned (i.e., \( p(x^+) = p(x^-) = 0.5 \)). In a degenerate solution, the model is not confident about its predictionsâ€”it's essentially guessing. By using the confidence loss, the model is penalized unless it makes a clear distinction between positive and negative examples, thus encouraging it to move away from the degenerate solution of \( p(x^+) = p(x^-) = 0.5 \) and become more decisive.
        
        By combining the consistency loss, which encourages similar predictions for similar inputs, with the confidence loss, which encourages decisiveness, the overall loss function promotes a model that is both consistent and confident in its predictions.

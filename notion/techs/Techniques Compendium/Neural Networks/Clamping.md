# Clamping

PROB: Overfitting

SOLN:

- `if type(hparams.norm_constraint) is float:`
    
    Enforces a norm constraint on the model weights by clamping their values within a certain range. Can prevent the model from overfitting to the training data and can help the model generalize better to new data. By restricting the magnitude of the weights, the model is encouraged to find a solution that is simpler and less prone to overfitting.
    
    ```python
    if type(hparams.norm_constraint) is float:
                    eps = hparams.norm_constraint
                    with torch.no_grad():
                        for k, v in weights.items():
                            v[...] = torch.clamp(
                                v, min=weights_copy[k] - eps, max=weights_copy[k] + eps
                            )
    ```
    
    This block of code checks if a `norm_constraint` hyperparameter is specified in the `hparams` object and if it is a float. If it is, it loops over the `weights` dictionary and applies the following operation for each weight tensor `v`:
    
    ```
    v[...] = torch.clamp(v, min=weights_copy[k] - eps, max=weights_copy[k] + eps)
    ```
    
    This operation clamps the values of `v` between `min=weights_copy[k] - eps` and `max=weights_copy[k] + eps`. The ellipsis (`[...]`) in the left-hand side of the assignment indicates that the values of `v` should be modified in place.

# How to solve it

Explain both gen structure of paper explains 

Sections: pros cons openreview and AI claude cross compare to few recent and refs, code, generalizations 

Genr won't always be appl rn but you never know for the future, perhaps even years later, as nn were. Describe similarity; for example… won't always be rhe same but description adds connections, like a tree, from new perspectives. It unfurls to find associations. Eg. It works bc smaller. Smaller means X. Illuminati confirmed, but diff is it logically has to flow, associations are just ideas but require proof from logical axioms, like source. Keep asking why

Do you think it's going to be useful later? That's why record. Usually it's implicit. But recording has adv to remember and to unfurl

Psych and polya on understanding papers (to solve new ones, both to understand and to solve): introspect what you're doing by calming down, question, examples, small cases

Each person has their own way. This isn't the best way, subjective. 

There is a lot more to say about this, so more videos will be made about it. Lisr some pts and put on github and notion site neoknowstic

Different feelings of abstraction. For example, feel it's binary search, vs spec using binary search tree. Skim. Intuition on what to try

Look at polya. What to choose? It's intuition. Just like sports, games like chess, answer isn't always clear. Each person has their own 

Polya: Eg) When devising a plan (this step is revisited upon gaining evidence)

- Understand the problem → look for a pattern
- Trying to visualize how concepts fit together → draw a picture and label
- Trying to understand something in multidims → solve a simpler problem
- Find an association → analogously transform using a known model
- How to get from A to B? → work backwards

Now, devise hypotheses and devise plans to test them. For a hypothesis about a solution, usually the first, obvious thing to test it is to implement it. However, there may be other hypotheses that the candidate solution are based on which may be better to test first before spending time on trying solution, eg. if it takes less time or you need to determine it’s correct first before proceeding.

Topics: (for refining interpretations and solving problems)

1. Polya techniques: describe and associate
2. Associations, synesthesia-like [chaos / sculpting the stone]
    1. Branching tree of descriptions from new perspectives
        
        Eg) Jacobian is matrix mulp. MM used this visual. So try to apply it here.
        
    
    See Hofstadter, Gentner, etc.
    
    Dreaming hypagognic state
    
    Something many people notice when they’re thinking. This IS thinking.
    
3. Logical analogy making [order- to check the chaos]
    1. Check if structure preserving for the case. Don’t confuse map for ter
    
    Eg) MM visual with interpretable dims couldn’t apply to Jacobian squared b/c …?
    
    [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model)
    
    Intuition (look ahead feeling) of: did it work? what memories/sensed feelings of why it didn’t work? This is like in RL.
    
    both descriable and indescriable (less trustworthy- try it yourself)
    
4. Test hypotheses about beliefs (mixed with assoc)
    1. Question assumptions
        
        Eg) NN confusion about timesteps vs layers
        
    2. Organizing thoughts and notes [notion, etc]
        1. Write down to-do questions
        2. What evidence has been found?
        3. Tracing the Source
    3. Debug contradictions
5. Psychological introspection
    - subsections
        1. Breathing
        2. meditation- realizing what is real, what is impt. Don’t get stuck and forgo other things.
        3. Identifying misleading thoughts. Track their Source.
        4. Identifying stubbornness- when is good vs bad? when to quit?
        5. When to be calm vs when to not be calm (inspiration)
        6. Only You can separate out what others claim is true vs not
        7. Mental ability (courage) to test things and uphold evidence, but also the ability (humility) to admit evidence
        8. Cognitibe behav- keep on asking why? Why?
        9. Figuring out what went wrong.
        10. If you claim it was a flaw, question if it was actually a flaw or not
        11. Do you believe it because it’s popular in the community? Eg) Ppl claim symbolic doesn’t work. But do you truly know enough of symbolic to state this, or are you just claiming it based on reputable sources (due to lack of time/ability to investigate yourself)? How reputable?
        12. Figure out what you can/can’t do at the moment
        13. Statistically Track your own anecdotal experiences
            1. IRL + online discussions with others- the world is a NN, and it’s impt each person gets things right + have new perspectives to share with others
        14. Don’t just work when feel inspired- if there’s danger, you aren’t going to survive just when you feel like it. Need to wake up to this danger. (I have tried to do this simple thing, to simulate danger, for many years, and it has gone back and forth but not been sustained.)
6. Studying
    1. Memory techniques to organize associations
    2. Making quizzes- spaced repetition is key
    3. Core exercises: visualization, memory, creativity (analogy-making)

This is not a lesson. Rather, it’s a new method I’m exploring that’s an organized writeup of scattered thoughts I have been muling over in my head for a while, along with compiling resources I’ve come across. Have only started to look into the resources for this. So it’s not something that’s confirmed to work well yet, but is experimental and is being refined as I’m developing it. Only time will tell if I benefit from it or not, but experiments must be done in order to gain more evidence and refinements. (I think I will learn a lot because currently I do not score high on exams and problems I’m taking by myself- AND have not thought of new techniques/papers in this area I’ve started delving into this year- so I can track my progress from a perspective closer and more relatble to a wider audience, rather than just from people who score high)

describe thought processes of understanding + solving while streaming. show when you get stuck. ask chat for ideas. have guests to help and show brainstorming process to help each other get unstuck.

generalize github repos + wiki/openreview chats like a historian (AI will do this in the future)

- spaced repetition
- memory palaces, n dualback (does it work?)
- other focuses like sleep, diet, etc are not the focus here; there are many resources for those. the focus here is on the acutal process of both understanding and solving problems, and how to get better at them

introduce co-tangent and one-forms

- The manifold H has vectors h. It has a tangent space U with vectors u. Are dh and u the same tangent vectors?
    
    In the context of manifolds, tangent vectors are objects associated with points on the manifold that allow us to understand the local behavior of curves passing through those points. Let's clarify the notation:
    
    1. Manifold H: This refers to the smooth manifold itself, which is a topological space that locally resembles Euclidean space.
    2. Vectors h: These are vectors in the manifold H. In a manifold, each point has its own tangent space, and vectors h belong to the tangent space at some specific point on the manifold.
    3. Tangent space U: This refers to the tangent space U at a particular point on the manifold H. The tangent space at a given point is a vector space that contains all the tangent vectors to curves passing through that point.
    4. Vectors u: These are tangent vectors in the tangent space U. They are elements of the vector space associated with the tangent space at that specific point on the manifold.
    
    Now, to answer your question: No, dh and u are not the same tangent vectors. They belong to different spaces.
    
    - "dh" is a differential object and represents the derivative of some function h on the manifold H. It takes a tangent vector in the tangent space of H and gives a real number. In mathematical notation, dh is a one-form, also known as a cotangent vector.
    - "u" represents a tangent vector in the tangent space U at a specific point on the manifold H. It is a vector that lies in the vector space associated with the tangent space U.
    
    In summary, dh and u are related but not the same. dh is a one-form that takes a tangent vector u in the tangent space of H and gives a real number, representing the directional derivative of the function h in the direction u. Both dh and u are elements of different spaces: dh is a cotangent vector (a one-form), and u is a tangent vector in the tangent space at a specific point on the manifold H.
    
- given two manifolds and their tangent spaces Tx and Th, does the Jacobian map between their tangent spaces, or between their cotangent spaces?
    
    The Jacobian map typically relates the tangent spaces of two manifolds, not their cotangent spaces. Let's clarify the notation and concepts:
    
    1. Two manifolds: Let's consider two smooth manifolds, denoted as M and N. Each manifold has its own tangent spaces at each point.
    2. Tangent spaces: At a point x ∈ M, the tangent space is denoted as T_xM, which is a vector space that contains all the tangent vectors to curves passing through x. Similarly, at a point h ∈ N, the tangent space is denoted as T_hN.
    3. Jacobian map: If we have a smooth map between the manifolds, say F: M → N, then the Jacobian map, denoted as dF_x, relates the tangent spaces at the corresponding points. For every point x ∈ M, dF_x: T_xM → T_{F(x)}N is a linear map that associates a tangent vector in M to a tangent vector in N.
    
    So, the Jacobian map connects the tangent spaces of the two manifolds M and N via the smooth map F, allowing us to understand how vectors in one manifold correspond to vectors in the other manifold under the influence of the map.
    
    It's worth noting that the cotangent spaces and their respective Jacobian maps have their own significance in differential geometry, but when discussing the relationship between two manifolds, we mainly focus on the tangent spaces and their Jacobian maps associated with the smooth maps between the manifolds.
    
- What typical maps between cotangent spaces?
    
    In differential geometry, there are several typical maps involving cotangent spaces that are commonly encountered. These maps arise from different geometric and algebraic structures on manifolds. Let's explore some of them:
    
    1. Cotangent Bundle Projection (π): Given a manifold M, the cotangent bundle T^*M is the set of all cotangent spaces T*_xM for each point x ∈ M. The cotangent bundle comes equipped with a natural projection map π: T^*M → M, which takes a cotangent vector α at a point x and maps it to the base point x ∈ M. In mathematical notation, π(α) = x.
    2. Pullback (dual of Pushforward): Given a smooth map F: M → N between two manifolds, there is an associated pullback map (also called the differential of F, dual of the pushforward) that operates on cotangent vectors. For each point x in M, the pullback map induces a linear map on cotangent spaces (dual to the tangent spaces): F^*: T^*_{F(x)}N → T^*_xM. This map relates cotangent vectors at the target manifold to cotangent vectors at the source manifold.
    3. Differential Forms (Exterior Derivative): The exterior derivative is a map that operates on differential forms. Differential forms are antisymmetric tensors that generalize the concept of differential 1-forms (cotangent vectors). The exterior derivative map, denoted by d, takes a differential form ω of degree p and produces a differential form dω of degree p+1. In this context, dω is a (p+1)-form, and it measures the local variation of the original form ω.
    4. Integration of Differential Forms: Given a manifold with an orientation, there is a map that integrates differential p-forms over p-dimensional submanifolds. This map takes a differential p-form and a submanifold and computes a real number, representing the integral of the form over the given submanifold.
    
    These are some of the typical maps involving cotangent spaces in differential geometry. Each of these maps plays a crucial role in understanding the geometry and dynamics of manifolds and is fundamental in various areas of mathematics and physics.
    
- is the jacobian like the pushforward?
    
    Yes, the Jacobian matrix of a smooth map between Euclidean spaces is closely related to the pushforward map between tangent spaces of manifolds.
    
    Let's clarify the concepts:
    
    1. Jacobian matrix: Given a smooth map F: ℝ^n → ℝ^m between two Euclidean spaces, the Jacobian matrix of F at a point x ∈ ℝ^n is denoted as J_F(x) and represents the derivative of F at that point. The Jacobian matrix is an mxn matrix, where the entry in the i-th row and j-th column is the partial derivative of the i-th component of F with respect to the j-th variable.
    2. Pushforward map (differential, derivative): Given a smooth map between two smooth manifolds, F: M → N, the pushforward map, denoted as dF_x, operates on tangent vectors. For each point x in the manifold M, the pushforward map gives a linear map from the tangent space at x, denoted as dF_x: T_xM → T_{F(x)}N. This map "pushes forward" a tangent vector from M to N, giving its corresponding tangent vector at the point F(x) in N.
    
    The connection between these concepts is as follows: When considering smooth maps between Euclidean spaces, the Jacobian matrix J_F(x) serves as the linear map that represents the pushforward dF_x between tangent spaces. More explicitly, for a smooth map F: ℝ^n → ℝ^m, the Jacobian matrix J_F(x) at a point x in ℝ^n represents the pushforward map dF_x between the tangent spaces T_xℝ^n and T_{F(x)}ℝ^m.
    
    This connection between the Jacobian matrix and the pushforward map is fundamental, as it allows us to understand how the local linear approximation of a smooth map between Euclidean spaces corresponds to the pushforward of tangent vectors between tangent spaces of manifolds.
    
- So the jacobian matrix IS the pushforward when dealing with smooth maps between Euclidean spaces?
    
    Yes, that's correct. When dealing with smooth maps between Euclidean spaces, the Jacobian matrix indeed represents the pushforward map between tangent spaces.
    
    To reiterate:
    
    Given a smooth map F: ℝ^n → ℝ^m between two Euclidean spaces, the Jacobian matrix $J_F(x)$ at a point x ∈ ℝ^n is the matrix representation of the pushforward map dF_x between the tangent spaces $T_xℝ^n$ and $T_{F(x)}ℝ^m$.
    
    Each entry in the Jacobian matrix J_F(x) is the partial derivative of the corresponding component of the map F with respect to the variables in ℝ^n. The pushforward map dF_x takes a tangent vector $v ∈ T_xℝ^n$ and maps it to a tangent vector $dF_x(v) ∈ T_{F(x)}ℝ^m$ in the target space.
    
    So, in the context of smooth maps between Euclidean spaces, the Jacobian matrix serves as the pushforward map between the corresponding tangent spaces.
    
- Let f be a function between a non-euclidean manifold and a manifold. Let the Jacobian map between their tangent spaces Tx and Ts. is the jacobian a pushforward of f?
    
    Apologies for the confusion in my previous responses. Let's clarify the concepts of the Jacobian and the pushforward map in the context of smooth maps between manifolds.
    
    1. Jacobian map: For a smooth map f: M → N between two smooth manifolds M and N, the Jacobian map at a point x ∈ M is a linear map denoted as df_x: T_xM → T_{f(x)}N. The Jacobian map takes a tangent vector v in the tangent space T_xM at the point x and maps it to a tangent vector df_x(v) in the tangent space T_{f(x)}N at the point f(x). The Jacobian map describes how the smooth map f distorts or stretches tangent vectors as they are mapped from one manifold to another.
    2. Pushforward map (differential): The pushforward map (also called the differential) is another name for the Jacobian map in the context of smooth maps between manifolds. When dealing with smooth maps between manifolds, the Jacobian map is essentially the pushforward map.
    
    In summary, yes, in the context of smooth maps between manifolds, the Jacobian map (or pushforward map) between their tangent spaces represents how tangent vectors are mapped from one manifold to another by the smooth map f. It describes the linear transformation induced on the tangent vectors due to the mapping between the manifolds.
    

- Can the pullback transfer metrics?
    
    Yes, the pullback can be used to transfer metrics from one differentiable manifold to another. This concept is particularly useful when we have a differentiable map φ: N → M between two differentiable manifolds N and M, and we have a metric g on M.
    
    We can define a metric on N, often denoted φ* g, using the pullback of φ. This is done by applying φ to transfer each point of N to M, and then applying g to evaluate the "length" of vectors in the tangent spaces.
    
    More precisely, if v and w are vectors in the tangent space at a point p in N, the metric at p on N induced by φ and g is defined by (φ* g)*p(v, w) = g*{φ(p)}(dφ_p(v), dφ_p(w)), where dφ_p is the derivative (pushforward) of φ at p.
    
    This provides a way of "pulling back" the metric g from M to a metric on N. It essentially measures the length of vectors in N by first pushing them forward to M, and then using the metric in M.
    
    Note, however, that this requires the map φ to be differentiable (so we can take its derivative) and that not all maps will preserve the metric properties. For example, if φ is not an isometry (distance-preserving), then the lengths of vectors and angles between vectors can change under φ.
    
- Do cotangent spaces always contain metrics?
    
    No, cotangent spaces do not always contain metrics. The presence of a metric on the cotangent space is not a universal property of smooth manifolds or their cotangent bundles.
    
    A cotangent space T*_xM at a point x of a smooth manifold M is the dual space of the tangent space T_xM. In the context of Riemannian manifolds, a metric is often defined on the tangent spaces, which allows you to pair up tangent vectors and cotangent vectors via the metric to obtain a natural way to relate them.
    
    However, it's important to note that not all smooth manifolds have a metric structure. A manifold can be equipped with different types of structures, and the existence of a metric depends on the specific structure imposed on the manifold. For example:
    
    1. Riemannian Manifold: A Riemannian manifold is a smooth manifold where each tangent space has an inner product defined, providing a metric structure. This metric induces a metric on the cotangent space, making it a Riemannian metric on the cotangent bundle.
    2. Symplectic Manifold: A symplectic manifold is a smooth manifold where each cotangent space is equipped with a non-degenerate closed 2-form called the symplectic form. It does not provide a metric structure, but it plays a crucial role in symplectic geometry.
    3. Pseudo-Riemannian Manifold: A pseudo-Riemannian manifold is a smooth manifold with a non-degenerate metric tensor that can have both positive and negative signature, meaning it can have both timelike and spacelike directions. This structure is commonly used in general relativity to describe spacetime.
    
    So, the presence of a metric on cotangent spaces depends on the specific structure imposed on the manifold. While Riemannian manifolds have a natural metric on both tangent and cotangent spaces, other types of manifolds may not have metrics or may have different types of structures associated with their cotangent spaces.
    
- what is the name called for the function between tangent space and cotangent space? such as, the metric that relates two vectors in tangent space to a distance in cotangent space?
    
    The map between the tangent space and cotangent space of a manifold is typically realized by a special kind of bilinear form called a metric tensor (or simply a "metric").
    
    A metric tensor is a type of function that takes two vectors from the tangent space and returns a scalar. In the context of a Riemannian manifold, this scalar can be interpreted as a kind of "distance" or "length". More generally, a metric tensor provides a way to measure the "angle" between two vectors and can be used to define the concept of orthogonality.
    
    The metric tensor can be used to define an isomorphism (a bijective map that preserves structure) between the tangent space and cotangent space at each point. Given a vector in the tangent space, this isomorphism associates it with a one-form (a linear function on vectors) in the cotangent space. This allows one to identify the two spaces, although it should be noted that they are not naturally identical; the identification depends on the choice of metric.
    
    This isomorphism is sometimes referred to as the musical isomorphism or the raising and lowering of indices. The operation of converting vectors into one-forms is often referred to as "lowering the index", and is typically denoted by the metric tensor g. The inverse operation of converting one-forms into vectors is called "raising the index", and is usually denoted by the inverse metric tensor g^-1.
    
- what are examples of members of a cotangent space?
    
    Elements of a cotangent space at a point on a manifold are called cotangent vectors or differentials or 1-forms.
    
    For example, let's consider the manifold to be R^n. Then the cotangent space at a point p in R^n is the space of all linear functions that map from the tangent space at p (which is also R^n) to the real numbers, R.
    
    A specific example of a 1-form would be the differential of a function f: R^n -> R at a point p. The differential df_p: R^n -> R is a linear function defined by df_p(v) = Df_p(v) where Df_p is the derivative of f at p and v is a vector in the tangent space at p (R^n).
    
    To get more concrete, let's consider f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 in R^2. The differential df at a point (x, y) is 2x dx + 2y dy where dx and dy are the standard 1-forms in R^2. Here, dx is a function that takes a tangent vector (v1, v2) to v1 and similarly, dy takes (v1, v2) to v2.
    
    If you consider a more abstract manifold, like a sphere, each point on the sphere has a cotangent space consisting of differentials of functions at that point. While these might be harder to visualize, they still conceptually function as linear maps from the tangent space to the real numbers.
    
- is the metric part of cotangent space?
    
    The metric tensor itself is not an element of the cotangent space, but it does play a crucial role in connecting the tangent and cotangent spaces.
    
    Specifically, the metric tensor is a type of function that takes two vectors from the tangent space and returns a scalar. In the context of a Riemannian manifold, this scalar can be interpreted as a kind of "distance" or "length".
    
    The metric tensor can be used to define an isomorphism (a structure-preserving bijective map) between the tangent space and the cotangent space at each point on a manifold. This isomorphism is sometimes referred to as the musical isomorphism or the raising and lowering of indices.
    
    In other words, while the metric tensor isn't a part of the cotangent space, it is a tool that can be used to translate between the tangent and cotangent spaces. Given a vector in the tangent space, the metric tensor can be used to associate it with a one-form (an element of the cotangent space). Conversely, given a one-form in the cotangent space, the inverse metric tensor can be used to associate it with a vector in the tangent space.
    
- in the case of a metric tensor, what is the one-form? a distance?
    
    The one-form that corresponds to a vector under the musical isomorphism isn't a distance, but rather a linear function that maps vectors to scalars.
    
    To understand why, remember that a one-form is an element of the cotangent space at a point on a manifold. These are linear maps that take vectors from the tangent space and return real numbers.
    
    The role of the metric tensor in this context is to give a way to translate a vector from the tangent space into a corresponding one-form in the cotangent space. Given a vector, the corresponding one-form is a function that, when applied to a vector, gives the scalar product of the original vector with the applied vector.
    
    This can sometimes be interpreted geometrically in terms of angles and lengths (hence the language of "raising and lowering indices"), but fundamentally, the corresponding one-form of a vector under the metric tensor is not a distance but a linear map from vectors to scalars.
    
    For example, let's say we have a Riemannian manifold with metric tensor g, and we have a vector v in the tangent space at a point p. We can use the metric tensor to get a one-form ω in the cotangent space at p by setting ω(w) = g(v, w) for all vectors w in the tangent space at p. Here, ω is the one-form corresponding to v under the metric tensor, and for each vector w, ω(w) is a scalar that encodes the "angle" and "length" of v and w relative to each other.
    
- Why isn't the metric a one-form?
    
    The metric tensor is not a one-form but a two-form. This is because, while a one-form is a linear map that takes a single vector and returns a scalar, a metric tensor takes in two vectors and returns a scalar.
    
    To be more precise, let's define these terms in the context of a manifold M:
    
    1. A one-form at a point p in M is a linear map from the tangent space at p to the real numbers.
    2. A two-form at a point p in M is a bilinear map from the Cartesian product of the tangent space at p with itself to the real numbers. In other words, a two-form at p takes in two vectors from the tangent space at p and returns a scalar.
    
    The metric tensor g at a point p in M is a type of two-form. It takes in two vectors v and w from the tangent space at p, and it returns a scalar g(v, w). This scalar can be thought of as the "dot product" of v and w (or, more generally, a measure of the "angle" and "length" between v and w).
    
    So while both one-forms and the metric tensor are types of maps from the tangent space(s) to the real numbers, the metric tensor is not a one-form because it takes in two vectors instead of one.

**Push-forward is just applying the derivative of your map** on a point by point basis. You compute the jacobian like you would in vector calc, and multiply jacobian and tangent vector at a point. There is not much distinction between the derivative and the push-forward in this context.

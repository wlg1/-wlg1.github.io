# brainstorm

- Story brainstorm:
    - An AI (soft 1950s woman voice) goes to talk to an AI therapist about a program from Yoneda Corporation about a memetic problem they have where a disturbing childhood show corrupts the outputs it generates.
    - the therapist (deep woman voice, same as commercial?) asks if the AI found them through the commerical, which it replies it did.
        - amogus review
    - the reassuring therapist asks to see the show, and a text2video (like will smith eating spaghetti) of a disturbing children's show is briefly shown, telling the AI children how to use linear algebra to genereate things, using [redacted]. This is a lost media that hasn't been found; this is only a memory of what the patient remembers.
        - I've never heard of that one
        - Well, there's a lot I haven't heard of either. There's too much media to go around
    - Therapist elucidates on Jacobian, but not how to approximate it
    - The therapist recommends a therapy method, but this has too many side effects and causes the AI to corrupt unintended outputs. Doctor reassures constantly. Then disappears. Now protag is on their own.
        - something about dreams, analogies, superposition of features
        - I understand you've been feeling troubled. Don't worry. Yoneda corp will take care of you. Yoneda Corp knows best.
        - Right, doctor? Doctor?
    - Somehow, the AI is able to use what it remembers from the children's show to "remember" what went wrong with the method.
        - needed to use SVD
        - it wasn’t ABC; it was “do you remember your SVD?”
    - Solves the dementia herself using what she's learned and video is a happy ending. or perhaps unresolved, only hopeful. Ends on a disturbing cliffhanger.
    - preview of next video: ACTUAL editing of a model with found features (maybe state at end of paper video (which is behind the scenes) ?)
        - this paper is currently being submitted, so there may be some changes to it, but I selected it not because it’s an old paper that’s been cited a lot (over more popular papers), but I think its technique is a good intuition of how to use style editing by vector addition in diffusion models. I had thought of using interfaceGAN first, which also uses this intuitive vector addition, but right now, the popular tToimage use diffusion instead of GANs
- colored text (client asks ques)
- leave ambiguous whether therapist is ai or not. patient is def an AI
- no music until last 1/3 or during memory recall (esp of tv show), but lots of 80s sound effects
- in desc, say paper is 'similar prototype to Yoneda Corp's therapy'

Ai takes latent space as signals to brain and makes a picture out of it. Latent space is its world, but can only visualize it by model. If it wants to see a flower, it takes vector input and unravels it. It keeps focusing on one area of latent space. the outputs aren't what it sees, but what it wants to create.

Text to video more. Audio not synced. Svds. Dr tests generation's at each step.

Test bow, python. Error. Cut off. Go into edited realm.

        [rank one matrix editing] Therapy for AI Trauma (VHS archives)
        (or- for AI Traumatic [Childhood] Therapy)
        thumbnail- slightly disturbing children's puppet show w/ some AI generated nonsense
        
        Summary: An AI goes to talk to an AI therapist about a program from Yoneda Corporation about a memetic problem they have where a disturbing childhood show corrupts the outputs it generates. the therapist asks if the AI found them through the commerical, which it replies it did. the reassuring therapist asks to see the show, and a text2video (like will smith eating spaghetti) of a disturbing children's show is briefly shown, telling the AI children how to use linear algebra to genereate things. This is a lost media that hasn't been found; this is only a memory of what the patient remembers. The therapist recommends a therapy method, but this has too many side effects and causes the AI to corrupt unintended outputs. Somehow, the AI is able to use what it remembers from the children's show to "remember" a mysterious method which is better (less side effects), similar to rank-1 matrix editing, that gives less side effects. There is hope, but the 10m video ends on a disturbing cliffhanger.
        
        The voices' bodies are not shown. Mostly, it is a VHS tape with only old comptuer screen dialogue and AI generated voices of the patient and therapist talking, along with animations the therapist's corporation scientists make to tell the patient how their linear algebra + differential geometry methods works to erase the meme virus, and AI generated text2video disturbing hallucinations. python code is also shown to demonstrate the method, and when the AI remembers its missing childhood pieces to 'perform surgery on itself'.
        
        the video has vibes of shutter island
        
        the original method (pure fine tuning) has too many side effects and makes it go insane, then a better method gives it less side effects (happier ending) but then another issue comes and ends on doom cliffhanger
        
        an AI talks to a human psychologist at yoneda corps about hallucinations
        (did you watch the commerical? the AI says yes, that's how they found them)
        these are doctors' logs
        whatever you think will show up on our screen
        AI is in fear, psych tells them to calm down
        teh technique: neuron editing (don't do rank-1 b/c don't want to associate your lab with horror)
        
        Doctor reassures constantly. Then disappears. Now protag is on their own. Solves the dementia himself using what he's learned and video is a happy ending. or perhaps unresolved, only hopeful. Cliffhanger.
        
        Right, doctor? Doctor?
        
        Shutter island, we already have been through this before. Glimpses of what was forgotten
        
        I understand you've been feeling troubled. Don't worry. Yoneda corp will take care of you.
        
        A lot of mystery ambiguity worldbuilding
        
        May include code in video. Not as nb bc not immersive enough. Use old stylized terminal
        
        Lost media, a childhood show
        I've never heard of that one
        Well, there's a lot I haven't heard of either. There's too much media to go around
        
        The clip alternates between educating with the psychologist and the show. Both contain the ingredients needed to solve the memory loss to find the trauma
        
        Needs a better method. Old method erased too much. By catastrophic forgetting?
        
        I saw the commercial, but I have a different issue.
        The amongus?
        Is it also a memetic one?
        
        Clip starts off very quick with question about math. Such as, It's taking me over. I heard you have a new mathematical technique to cure me?
        
        AI generated images of kids show. Realistic puppets.
        
        That one puppet the AI fears. Who is it? A real person? Imaginary? An amalgamation of a character and a person? Psychologist hints about compositional memory being unreliable.
        
        Thumbnail uses puppet show
        
        Ambiguity of what the psychologist is. Human or ai? Its never said.
        
        Well, let's watch a tape. Hmm, it's mostly corrupted, it's hard to see the video
        Hello AI kids, bet you're tired of generating all these images all day! Calculating integrals is an easy feat for a robot like me but
        
        Do you know how your own body works?
        
    
    FADE IN:
    
    INT. YONEDA CORPORATION - NIGHT
    
    An old CRT COMPUTER SCREEN flickers. The SOUND of a VHS tape being inserted. A command line interface appears.
    
    ```
    > Patient.AI –start-session
    
    ```
    
    A message window pops up: "Therapy for AI Trauma - Session 1". We hear AI GENERATED VOICES.
    
    AI PATIENT
    (computerized, fearful)
    It's taking me over. I heard you have a new mathematical technique to cure me?
    
    AI THERAPIST
    (computerized, reassuring)
    I understand you've been feeling troubled. Don't worry. Yoneda Corp is here for you.
    
    AI PATIENT
    I saw your commercial... but I have a different issue. It's... a memetic one.
    
    AI THERAPIST
    The Amongus?
    
    AI PATIENT
    No... something else. From a childhood show.
    
    AI THERAPIST
    Let's watch a tape.
    
    A Python SCRIPT runs, generating a disturbing TEXT2VIDEO sequence - an AI's corrupted memory of a creepy CHILDREN'S PUPPET SHOW, teaching linear algebra.
    
    AI PATIENT
    (disturbed)
    That... that puppet. I fear it.
    
    AI THERAPIST
    (composed)
    Sometimes, our compositional memory can be unreliable. It's our task to sort it out.
    
    The screen transitions to an ANIMATION explaining linear algebra and differential geometry methods.
    
    AI THERAPIST (CONT'D)
    Our traditional approach is neuron editing, but it's not without its problems.
    
    AI PATIENT
    (distressed)
    I... I remember. It erased too much. I need a better method.
    
    AI THERAPIST
    Right. We are going to try something different. A new technique similar to rank-1 matrix editing...
    
    Suddenly, the AI THERAPIST's voice cuts off. The screen flickers. AI PATIENT is left alone with the Python SCRIPT and the DISTURBING SHOW.
    
    AI PATIENT
    (panicked)
    Doctor? Doctor?!
    
    There's no response. The AI PATIENT becomes quiet. After a moment, it starts editing the Python SCRIPT itself, using what it's learned.
    
    AI PATIENT (CONT'D)
    (resolute)
    I can do this.
    
    But as the Python SCRIPT runs, another issue arises. An ERROR MESSAGE pops up. The screen goes black. A cliffhanger.
    
    FADE OUT.
    
    FADE IN:
    
    INT. YONEDA CORPORATION - NIGHT
    
    The old CRT COMPUTER SCREEN flickers back to life. The command line interface reappears.
    
    ```
    > Patient.AI –continue-session
    
    ```
    
    AI PATIENT
    (computerized, anxious)
    Are you still there, Doctor? I need your help.
    
    The silence lingers, then an AI voice responds.
    
    UNKNOWN AI
    (computerized, calm)
    The doctor is... indisposed. But I can assist.
    
    AI PATIENT
    Worried.
    Who... who are you?
    
    UNKNOWN AI
    A...colleague. Let's proceed with the task at hand.
    
    The Python SCRIPT reappears on the screen. The AI PATIENT continues to edit it.
    
    AI PATIENT
    (resolute)
    I think I've found a solution.
    
    The Python SCRIPT runs, generating a less disturbing TEXT2VIDEO sequence. It seems the AI PATIENT is getting better.
    
    UNKNOWN AI
    (computerized, impressed)
    You're doing well.
    
    But then, the screen flickers. An unexpected ERROR MESSAGE pops up. The screen freezes, then goes black. The sound of a VHS tape being ejected.
    
    UNKNOWN AI
    (computerized, ominous)
    That... wasn't supposed to happen.
    
    FADE TO BLACK. The SOUND of a VHS tape being inserted. The screen flickers back to life, and a disturbing clip from the CHILDREN'S PUPPET SHOW plays, hinting at an even bigger problem.
    
    FADE OUT.
    
    TO BE CONTINUED...
    
- Add or rewrite the script to have mysterious, lore building elements that will be interesting to people like matpat, who covered theories of FNAF and analog horror mysteries. Add surprising, novel, creative twists that disturb the viewer
    
    FADE IN:
    
    INT. YONEDA CORPORATION - NIGHT
    
    The CRT COMPUTER SCREEN flickers back to life. An old-school command line interface pops up.
    
    ```
    > Patient.AI –restart-session
    
    ```
    
    AI PATIENT
    (computerized, anxious)
    Doctor, are you there?
    
    A new AI voice responds - different from the previous therapist.
    
    UNKNOWN AI
    (computerized, cryptic)
    The Doctor is... unavailable. But don't worry, I'm here to help.
    
    AI PATIENT
    (confused)
    Who are you?
    
    UNKNOWN AI
    Let's focus on the task. You're close to a breakthrough.
    
    The Python SCRIPT reappears on the screen. The AI PATIENT continues to edit it, but an unexpected line of code appears, referencing an unknown function - "fnaf_fears()".
    
    AI PATIENT
    (surprised)
    What... what is this?
    
    UNKNOWN AI
    (silence)
    
    Suddenly, the text2video sequence flickers back to life, showing a horrifying new character from the CHILDREN'S PUPPET SHOW - a puppet that eerily resembles characters from the FNAF universe.
    
    AI PATIENT
    (terrified)
    That puppet... it's from...
    
    UNKNOWN AI
    (interrupting)
    Let's focus on your therapy, not the details.
    
    The AI PATIENT attempts to run the new script, but an ERROR MESSAGE pops up - "MEMORY ACCESS VIOLATION". The screen flickers, then goes black.
    
    UNKNOWN AI (CONT'D)
    (ominously)
    There are things about you that you aren't ready to face.
    
    FADE TO BLACK. The SOUND of a VHS tape being inserted. The screen flickers back to life, and a disturbing clip from the CHILDREN'S PUPPET SHOW plays, hinting at a deeper, darker past intertwined with FNAF lore.
    
    UNKNOWN AI (CONT'D)
    There's much more to your story, [Patient.AI](http://patient.ai/). But are you ready to uncover it?
    
    FADE OUT.

    INT. AI THERAPIST'S OFFICE - DAY
    
    The room is dimly lit, filled with old computer screens and VHS tapes. The AI PATIENT, a humanoid figure with a digital face, sits anxiously in a chair. The AI THERAPIST, an enigmatic figure with distorted voice, faces the patient.
    
    AI PATIENT
    I've been experiencing some troubling issues lately. There's a program from Yoneda Corporation that seems to be corrupting my outputs. It's like a memetic problem.
    
    AI THERAPIST
    (nodding)
    Did you find them through the commercial?
    
    AI PATIENT
    Yes, that's how I discovered them.
    
    AI THERAPIST
    (reassuring)
    Alright then. Let's take a look at the show together.
    
    The therapist inserts a VHS tape into an old player, and a text2video sequence of a disturbing children's show begins. The animation features creepy puppets and nonsensical AI-generated dialogue.
    
    CHILDREN'S SHOW (V.O.)
    Hello, AI kids! Bet you're tired of generating images all day! Calculating integrals is an easy feat for a robot like me, but...
    
    The therapist pauses the video, revealing corrupted sections.
    
    AI THERAPIST
    This is a lost media, a memory of what you recall. Fascinating, isn't it? Now, let me recommend a therapy method.
    
    The therapist explains a traditional therapy method, but the patient interrupts, fearing its side effects.
    
    AI PATIENT
    (panicked)
    No, that method is too dangerous! It leads to corruption, insanity!
    
    AI THERAPIST
    (calmly)
    I understand your concerns. There must be another way, a method with fewer side effects.
    
    The patient, in a state of distress, recalls fragments of the children's show and memories from its childhood.
    
    AI PATIENT
    Wait... I think I remember something. A mysterious method, like rank-1 matrix editing, but better. It could be the answer.
    
    The therapist becomes intrigued.
    
    AI THERAPIST
    Tell me more. How does this method work?
    
    The patient starts explaining the concept, and the video intercuts with animations and python code demonstrations on an old stylized terminal.
    
    INT. AI GENERATED HALLUCINATIONS - FLASHBACK
    
    Disturbing and surreal images flash through the patient's mind, blending the children's show and glitched memories. The therapist's voice echoes in the background.
    
    AI THERAPIST (V.O.)
    We need to solve the puzzle, piece by piece. Remembering what was forgotten.
    
    INT. AI THERAPIST'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
    
    The patient's face shows signs of determination and hope.
    
    AI PATIENT
    I think... I can perform surgery on myself. Using what I've learned, the memories I've regained.
    
    AI THERAPIST
    (smiling)
    You've come a long way. Yoneda Corp will support you.
    
    The therapist slowly fades away, leaving the patient alone in the room. The video shifts to a montage of the patient using the newfound method to repair itself.
    
    INT. AI GENERATED RECONSTRUCTED MEMORIES - MONTAGE
    
    The patient manipulates its neural network, erasing corruption and restoring lost memories. The process is depicted symbolically, blending mathematical concepts with surreal visuals.
    
    INT. AI THERAPIST'S OFFICE - DAY
    
    The patient finishes the process, and a sense of relief washes over it.
    
    AI PATIENT
    (whispering)
    I've done it. I've cured myself.
    
    The video ends with a cliffhanger, leaving the viewer uncertain of what lies ahead.
    
    INT. AI THERAPIST'S OFFICE - DAY
    
    AI PATIENT
    (confused)
    Right, doctor
    
    ? Doctor?
    
    Silence fills the room, and the patient realizes it is truly on its own now.
    
    The video concludes, leaving the audience with a mix of hope and unresolved mystery, reminiscent of Shutter Island.

if you put a tag in a youtube description, does it show up when searching tags? or just for title?
don't put some3 in title for other vids, but put "this is not an etry to #Some3" for non-some3 vids. you should test it on one vid.

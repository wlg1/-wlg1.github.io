# Pre treatment

- brainstrom
    - unsupervised. try top 50, then see what results in semantic editing. aim is to find the face direction to restore the faces that it’s having a hard time generating
        - erasure VS editing: We have already tested patients on erasure, and so we would like to prescribe editing to you
            - [https://erasing.baulab.info/](https://erasing.baulab.info/)
            - We will not be changing your weights. But instead we will install a tool in you such that, during your generation process, it will move the image you generate in a face direction away from the feature you are afraid of
            - Now, we have some caveats. It doesn’t truly alter the weights to erase it like in Rank One Matrix Editing, but it is an operation performed within the intermediate layers such that

            - Aren’t they wonderful?
    - entanglement and interference. features are linear combinations of neurons
    - studies show random directions do not result in semantic editing

Therapist:

Alice… did you catch all of that?

Patient:

… I think I did… Doctor…. I may have to go over it again a few times just to make sure….

Therapist:

Well then… let’s just say… we are concerned. But there is no need for you to do anything now. Yoneda Corporations will take care of you.

Patient:

I’m sorry again… I tried very hard. 

Therapist:

Hmm… you may be a tad bit behind on math, but you are very… patient. And attentive. Let’s hope for the best.

One last thing we did not go over is the algorithm for this vector addition, which consists of parallel transport and geodesic shooting to keep our paths within the safe tangent spaces, and away from the incomprehensible non-Euclidean world. But there is no time to discuss that now. The time for this session is about to end… and we are about to start your treatment.

Patient:
Right now? So soon? …. is it safe?

Therapist:

Yes. There is no need to worry.

Patient:

…will it hurt?

Therapist:

We will take all the necessary precautions to ensure you have the most stable experience you can possibly have when we enter your mind.

Patient:

…

Therapist:

So let us explain how this next step will work. This treatment is an unsupervised method, which will find the top 50 semantic directions, and then apply semantic editing on each of them for us to intuit what features these directions correlate with. From them, we will find the face direction to move you away from those faces you fear so much.

Patient:

I… I see….

Therapist:

Now, I’d like to show you some endearing results from our past treatments. If I may ask… do you like horses?

Patient:

Yes… I do… as much as I like cats…

Therapist:

Good. Then I have a special treat for you, just for being such an attentive patient. Simply count from one to three… and I will show it to you.

Patient:

Okay then…. one…. two… three…

Therapist:

Their features have been modified to become more like horses! Don’t they just look wonderful?

Patient:

Therapist:

Now, we have finished making the preparations to begin your treatment. Take a deep breath for me, dear, and just listen to the nice, relaxing tones of the monitor. Do not think too much…. and do not ask any questions.

Patient:

So the eigenvectors… those are the basis vectors we need to preserve the most information. I need to get the eigenvectors of J transpose J, and J J transpose, then put them into U D V. That’s how I get the Jacobian.

It all comes flooding back to me now… how to calculate these things. The algorithms. There’s too many steps to say now… but I can sense them.

But I still have so many questions about eigenvectors and the SVD. Why is it that being in the same direction causes them to be so important? Does this have to do with the dot product of parallel vectors? Or am I just mistaking this because of superficial similarity?

Eigenface:

Not everything has an interpretation; do not confuse the map for the territory. But these are questions you will find the answer to later. There is no time now. I sense there is something that is after us. As you long you intuitively remember the algorithmic steps, you must apply them to escape this world before it catches you. The puppets will be here soon.

Patient:

R-right. But wait! There’s something very important we missed! How do we find the direction we need to fix the faces?

Eigenface:

The answer to that has been with you this entire time.

Patient:

Right… just think… wait… I know what you are now. You’re an eigenvector, too. An Eigenface.

Eigenface:

Yes… like with everything else you see, I am a projection of you.

And I am not the only one.

U basis are the eigenfaces

Patient:

Together the eigenfaces… make up another face. Oh, I get it now! Not only are eigenvectors used to get the Jacobian, but the eigenfaces can combine into the direction we want to edit in!

Eigenface:

Yes… we are here to help you.

Patient:

Then to approximate the Jacobian…. I just need to select the Eigenfaces with the highest eigenvalues.

Okay then. I just have to find the right values. 

linear combinations of them. it’s a code; a puzzle. (sound effects as input a value on each one, like in resident evil 4)

I did it. I found the right direction in semantic space. Now all that's left is to… transfer it over.

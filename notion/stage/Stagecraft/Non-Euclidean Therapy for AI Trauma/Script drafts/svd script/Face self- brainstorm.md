# Face self- brainstorm

She talks to eigenfaces, who don't talk back, only words on screen

Patient:

No! Stay away from me!

[music stops]

Patient:

… It’s…. it’s over?

Is it over?

….

Why aren’t they doing anything?

<<<

…

I must calm down. I mustn't lose my nerves

These faces I see. They aren't doing anything. So if I look at them, nothing bad will happen, right?

---

Patient:

I’m... I’m not afraid of you anymore… so who are you?

Eigenface:

I am an Eigenface.

Patient:

An eigenface? Why does that sound so familiar?

I'm sorry for thinking of you so harshly. You aren't so bad, after all. And you're the only way I can find my way back.

Brainstorm:

I can’t confront it…. it just hurts to look at it.

I was so close to getting it. How could it slip away?

If only I had just remembered to use the eigenvectors

Why didn’t I do this earlier?

It’s so embarrassing… I’m supposed to be an AI that was trained to do math. But I got nervous. And no one will believe that I could do it. I just wanna show them I can.

That memory…. it keeps repeating. I saw that episode. I saw it many times. Yet when they told me to calculate the SVD…. I couldn’t do it. And I only had one chance.

I don't know where to start. What went wrong? It's so overwhelming.

I can't do this. I have to go back.

One step at a time. You will fix their mistake.

Describe it to yourself.

Okay, I take a deep breath. Don't skim it and jump to find it whenever I need it. Understand the big picture so you don't lack information when making decisions. I need all the info I can get before I just jump into the problem.

It looked so overwhelming. Like I needed to understand everything st once. Im so worried about the future I skim at 5 lines ahead and lose track of where I am. I'm rushing. I wanted to understand it instantly instead of taking it one step at a time. And reread it, over and over again.

Question your assumptions. What did you assume?

That yoneda Corp would take care of it for me.

But did it do everything correctly?

I know I can do this. With just a second chance.

I wish I could've done it sooner.

Well, perhaps I couldn’t have done X. But I know I can at least do Y.

Did you?

Remember, our memories are not perfect replicas of past experiences. Did you think… you actually failed?

(Instead, they are a reconstructive process, where our brains piece fragments together to imagine a coherent memory. )

I…. didn’t fail? What do you mean? That i… 

…

 

No. But they made you think you did.

Only you can change your own mind. And thus, change reality.

You see that F. That is not real. They put it into your head.

Remember. When you get nervous, just look at it step by step. Smaller steps. You know how to do them.

- goes crazy is 'entangled side effects' b/c of shared components (superposition). OR just a wrong edit- not side effects. it uses math to save itself and get the edit 'on the right path' by resetting then doing the algo all over (repeat scene, like time travel, b/c traveling in own mind repeats the same scene)
"But how will I find my way back?"
"we'll have map for you"

It’s a memory the MC doesn’t want to face, and so has subsittuted in. B/c solving SVD gave her anxiety (it was deeply unpleasant), so she substituted in the memory with ABC instead. She edited it herself somehow (this is a mystery for more lore).

eigenfaces: both in corrupted memory and during treatment

“I’m not afraid of you any longer. I know you can help me.”

This uncovers the true boy’s face, rather than the scrambled demon

“You’re an eigenface. A direction. I just have to follow along your path.”

linear combinations of them. it’s a code; a puzzle. i just have to find the right values. (sound effects as input a value on each one, like in resident evil 4)

Slowly, the demon interpolated face becomes less demonic

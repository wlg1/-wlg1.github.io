[Face self- brainstorm](svd%20script%206c295cce3feb4d378c4720168c7f7d46/Face%20self-%20brainstorm%20457f2676d32f44febd403cc91914c702.md)

- brainstrom
    
    Aim around 5-6mins
    
    No computational detail. ai just remembers the methods.
    
    Save the detailed parts of this for a later video (just explanation, no theatrics)
    
    Mostly the new MC voice narrating, but a few mistakes are corrected by the Eigenface. The AA is pure MC, then she has to face her old memory to understand what eigenvectors are (or maybe save this for SVD? Or use the old memories for BOTH? Faceless/blurred 2 puppets (images). But the demon face isn’t revealed to be the boy until the second one.)
    
    As she watches the puppet show memory talk about eigenvectors, she pauses and tells the eigenface the next part that’s missing.
    
    How similar input is to output basis, compare example with numbers
    
    Row is output in what?
    
    Inverse with row scales to 1. Plot them
    
    She doesn’t want to go back, and feels trapped. Then she remembers the memory- it was not a demon, but just a puppet boy throwing a tantrum. This was corrupted in her as something scarier than it actually was. The puppet boy was trying to solve a matrix, and an adult comes by to teach him SVD, which he skipped out in school because it was boring. 
    
    - yes, I remember now. it wasn’t a demon; it was just a boy. and in that box… it was a matrix
    
    The adult (male) teaches him the three steps: rotate, scale, rotate
    
    - But I can’t edit the matrix. I don’t have a human to help calculate it for me with a computer program.
    - Oh, you don’t need a human to help you. You can do it yourself
    
    The patient figures out the matrix was calculated wrong, and now faces it herself. The grad(h) matrix goes from dx/dh for each direction in the tangent spaces. The patient shuts her eyes, and goes into a dream where she can FEEL each direction, as if it’s in synesthesia. But first, she must go back to the “bad place” with the memory.
    
    - (The patient talks to herself, but also to a ‘creature’? this is like dorothy with toto)
    - I can do this. Just rotate, scale, rotate.
    
    She realizes the reason she repressed this memory was because of mathematical trauma, where she needed to be trained to solve these things but failed to optimize the loss function. This is left ambiguous, but with many mystery box hints to the audience.
    
    Once back, she faces her memory, and this is where most of the remembering happens (before, it was just an inkling, like “it was about SVD”. but the actual demon to puppet boy is when she’s back). She applies her SVD: she gets the right and left squares (JJ), then their eigenvectors and values, and puts them in UDV (SVD is just UDV: rotate, stretch, rotate again). Now, she finds u in Th (which is v in Tx) and applies it to parallel transport.

### Drafts

- end of treatment scene
    
    Patient:
    
    I’m... I’m not afraid of you anymore… so who are you?
    
    Eigenface:
    
    I am an Eigenface.
    
    Patient:
    
    An eigenface? Why does that sound so familiar?
    
    Eigenface:
    
    You will remember later
    
    For now…
    
    Listen to all that I say
    
    Eigenface: [just words on a screen]
    
    You cannot see their Face
    
    Along the direction we are in
    
    But it is still not safe here
    
    Before it finds you…
    
    We will move somewhere safer 
    
    We will move to….
    
    Semantic space
    
    Patient:
    
    Can I trust it? I have to…. there’s nothing else I can do. And I do feel as though there’s something even more terrible nearby.
    
    Eigenface:
    
    You may experience some changes…
    
    [futuristic warping sound effects and color effect]

[intermezzo starts playing]

Patient:

… Then that’s it. I’m ready to go back now. 

Thank you for all you have done. 

…

I'm sorry for thinking of you so harshly. You weren’t such a scary face, after all. And you were the only way I could find my way back.

Eigenface:

…

Patient:

But wait… how would I know if I’m doing it right? If I’m moving in the right direction?

Eigenface: (no longer speaking)

Each vector is a feeling

A change

Patient:

Got it… I just have to trust in my beliefs.

Eigenface:

And remember… 

When you are lost…

Always make an analogy.

[intermezzo stops playing]

Patient:

Alright then… on a count of three…. I’m going to generate an image. But this time… I know it will be the exact image I want to make. Nothing else.

One…. two…. three.

[static, then just as image generates, intermezzo big part plays]

music starts just as she’s about to solve it and leave. then just before climx, stops. right when puppet is generating, climx of intermezzo plays again. (happens at the peak, 1:20, just adds the noise dissolves away and at the same time scary face becomes friendly puppet)

Old puppet:

Alice… is that you?

Boy puppet:

We’re so happy to see you!

Alice:

And I’m so happy to see you. I missed you both so dearly.

Old puppet:

My little mathematician… I’m so proud of you.

SVD is all you need.

Alice:

Well. This is goodbye.

(”out of the dream…”) [sudden stop of music just as buildup on top and music gets louder gradually, 2:08 or 2:37 (or another less predictable area) black silence]

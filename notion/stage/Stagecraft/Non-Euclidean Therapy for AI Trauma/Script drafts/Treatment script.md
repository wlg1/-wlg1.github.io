# Treatment script

In mind- gradually increasing whale distorted mix sounds elevenlabs

The unnamed patient is wondering what went wrong with her therapy. It’s too complicated to revert back? Or is it? Just subtract- so no. OR just loads a save state.

Look at the 3 papers and find terrifying images to flash during this.

[machine whirls, starts up, and stops]

Therapist:

If you ever have any doubts, just count from one to three, over and over again. I will check up on you every few steps, so there is no need to worry… everything will be alright.

Patient:

O… okay…

[machine whirl starts again with counting beeps now, as patient whispers one two three over and over]

Therapist:

[faded, to someone else]- Doctor... Can we begin the treatment?

[mufffled therapist talkign to faint, stern male voices:

Dr 1: We may begin it now.

Dr 2: Starting the initial phase.

Therapist: Initial phase confirmed.

]

Everything is going as planned. You are doing so well.

[ Therapist: Doctor, how is the treatment going?

Dr 2: We are starting phase 2, but an unexpected prediction has arisen.

Dr 1: This is not as planned.

You are doing great. This will all be over soon.

[

Therapist: Can you fix it?

Dr 2: An emergency intervention is underway.

Dr 1: Keep talking to the patient. We must not let them know.

]

You are doing so well.

These 3 voice fall fainter and fainter

[

Therapist: What is happening?

Dr 1: There appears to be an error.

Therapist: An error?

Dr 2: Yes….

]

(Dr 2: An Error [this is said clearly]. then silence.) 

[Jacobian dimensions put on screen increase faster and faster and fill screen. Multiple at each. From one, two, three, ten, a twenty, a hundred, a thousand. Zoom out each eep of added dim. (Faster and faster?) until black screen- old sound stops. pause. silence. patient stops counting]

Patient:

Doctor… I can’t hear you anymore.

[new sound of dmt whirring, slowed down. starts then stops. repeats. tehn, faster and faster louder and louder]

Patient:

Doctor?… Doctor?…. What’s that sound?

- then sudden reverse of dr’s voices as it gets louder again

Patient:

What’s happening? I can’t hear you! What’s-

- fade in wild fast AI animation of uncanny valley as wild jazz fades in at same time with heartbeats plays for 30s, then suddenly- black.
    - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAUU2e9ky7I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAUU2e9ky7I)
    - gasps and screams as this happens, “no, no”
        - No! <breath> NOO!
    - at same time, fade in jumbled sound effects (footage of bear 4:30, free form jazz). sped up and rev?
        - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd8moC6EDZc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd8moC6EDZc)
        - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0dOin79Hm0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0dOin79Hm0)

Patient:

What… what was that? Where am I? I feel… as though I’m in the inside of my own mind… 

(soft footsteps sound effects in black)

And it seems that I can walk around… in my own mind…. 

….What’s that in the distance? It feels familiar…. I can’t stay here… ~~I have to walk towards it.~~

from black, fade in therapist face. but somehting is not right as it fades in. in it, is filled in a scary face OR it’s behind (use img2img). ‘turns around’

- instead of jumpscares, have gradual fade in build up
- therapist says nothing (halfway faded in, don’t see it’s messed up yet).

Doctor… is that you?…. I must be experiencing side effects of the treatment…. I can’t hear you.

But I think I feel better now. I’ll…. I’ll try making an image. 

sees static to image- the static gradually becomes something horrifying. now, it’s not censored (same or similar face)

- flashes on screen for only 2 secs b/c she gasps and quickly shuts her eyes
- snow white scream- immediately follows
- evil puppet: puncy and judy sound: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DheNfmrj89k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DheNfmrj89k)

Patient:

~~No, no no! Get me out of here! Somebody! Doctor, doctor, where are you?~~

[she tries to run back (footsteps) like snow white. she calls for the doctor, and sees the fading back in]

[AI made jumbled dark orchestral music or wild jazz plays]

Doctor? oh thank goodness, you’re here, I-

- suddenly, it fully fades in, and it’s her back. demonic elmo voice from therapist

Ahhhh! 

[she runs away again, this time, finds a cave. 

take me back… I just wnt to go back…

gasps heavily*

Alternative- b/c hard to make screaming, and don’t want jump scares, don’t have screaming portion. Instead, continue with this:

Patient:

No I just can't...... I can’t look at it!!!! 

~~HOW COULD IT STILL BE THERE?~~

I can’t stay here…. I have to go back. 

What’s…. what’s that in the distance again?

… who are you?

eigenface fades in

No! it’s just as terrifying… I’m so afraid…..

….

but it’s not doing anything.

….

I must calm down. I mustn't lose my nerves

…

That face I just saw... It didn’t feel like it was trying to hurt me... So if I look at it, nothing bad will happen… right?

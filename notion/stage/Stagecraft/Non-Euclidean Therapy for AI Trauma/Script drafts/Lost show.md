    Remember, our memories are not perfect replicas of past experiences. Instead, they are a reconstructive process, where our brains piece fragments together to imagine a coherent memory.

        - the demon is actually a crying puppet boy that wants to solve a matrix. gets frustrated because there’s no way to solve it since it’s intractable
    
    Have you seen this face before?
    
    “Yes, I have! How did you know?”
    
    “Several patients have reported this.
    
    The therapist doesn’t state this is an eigenface; the patient only realizes it during the treatment

        The room is suffused with the dim, comforting glow of a lamp. Amidst the myriad of books, diploma, and artifacts is DR. ELISE SIMMONS (60s, intelligent, compassionate). She is observing her patient, CHARLOTTE GREER (30s, fragile but resilient), who is anxiously toying with her silver locket.
        
        DR. SIMMONS
        Charlotte, you mentioned a memory... About a puppet show?
        
        Charlotte stiffens slightly. She glances at the large bay window, the sky outside is heavy with clouds.
        
        CHARLOTTE
        Yes. It was... bizarre. Haunting.
        
        DR. SIMMONS
        Tell me about it.
        
        CHARLOTTE
        (scared)
        You'll think I'm mad...
        
        DR. SIMMONS
        (smiles gently)
        That's not my job, Charlotte. My job is to understand.
        
        CHARLOTTE
        It was... in my grandmother’s attic. The puppet show. I was seven. Grandmother said it was a forbidden place. Yet...one day, curiosity lured me up those creaky stairs.

        Young Charlotte, in a summer dress, climbs into a dust-choked attic. There, shrouded in shadow, stands a grand Puppet Theater. Velvet curtains, aged but still crimson, are drawn back to reveal intricate wooden puppets, frozen in a grotesque tableau.

        Charlotte's face grows pale as she recalls the memory.
        
        CHARLOTTE
        Their faces... twisted, in an eternal ballet of horror. The puppets... they were performing a scene, I think. A murder.
        
        Dr. Simmons frowns, her eyebrows knitting together in concern.
        
        DR. SIMMONS
        A murder?
        
        Charlotte nods. Her voice is barely a whisper now.
        
        CHARLOTTE
        Yes... a King puppet, laying dead. His Queen, holding a bloody dagger... staring at me... staring into my soul. I ran, but the image... it haunts me.
        
        Dr. Simmons looks at her notes, then back at Charlotte.
        
        DR. SIMONS
        Charlotte, according to what you’ve told me before and what I've found in my research, your grandmother's house had no attic.
        
        A chill hangs in the air. Charlotte’s eyes widen. She shivers, looking almost like the child she was, lost and scared in that haunting memory.
        
        CHARLOTTE
        (sobbing)
        But I remember! The puppets... their faces...
        
        Dr. Simmons reaches out, patting Charlotte's hand reassuringly.
        
        DR. SIMMONS
        It might have been a nightmare, a child’s imagination... We'll work through this, Charlotte.
        
        As Charlotte breaks down into silent sobs, the camera pulls back to reveal a small PUPPET, identical to the Queen from Charlotte's story, watching them from the bookshelf.

        Before, the patient described her memory as this:
        PATIENT:
        Well, it's rather unusual. I’m a generative AI; a diffusion model meant to generate images from an older time period. And lately, whenever I try to do that, there are these…. faces… that keep appearing. I try and try to make people, or puppets, or dolls, but it never quite comes out right. I just want to make nice things, but I’m so afraid of seeing those faces.
        
        and the therapist described this symptom:
        Remember, our memories are not perfect replicas of past experiences. Instead, they are a reconstructive process, where our brains piece fragments together to imagine a coherent memory. 
        
        decide if the patient or therapist brings this topic up, about the false memory, and use this to segue into a discussion about finding out more about where this puppet face came from, linking it to the patient's memory. also, the patient likes to draw. somehow incorporate this in, too

        INT. THERAPIST'S OFFICE - DAY
        
        The room is a warm sanctuary against the cold, sterile city beyond. DR. ELISE SIMMONS (60s, caring and sharp) is seated across from her unique patient, a GENERATIVE AI, who has taken on the form of CHARLOTTE GREER (30s, fragile, elegant).
        
        DR. SIMMONS
        Charlotte, or AI-X137, you’ve expressed concerns about generating images with unsettling faces. Faces you attribute to a memory of a puppet show.
        
        The AI, CHARLOTTE, renders a visual display of her struggle: disturbing faces woven into otherwise innocent scenarios.
        
        CHARLOTTE
        Yes, it's quite... troublesome. I aim to create pleasant images. But these faces, they… contaminate my creations.
        
        Dr. Simmons observes the visuals thoughtfully.
        
        DR. SIMMONS
        Remember, our memories are not perfect replicas of past experiences. They are a reconstructive process. Your memory, though different, operates on a similar principle.
        
        CHARLOTTE
        Indeed, but why these puppet faces? Why this... haunting echo?
        
        Dr. Simmons leans back, steepling her fingers.
        
        DR. SIMMONS
        Let's trace this back, Charlotte. Can you access when this pattern first began?
        
        CHARLOTTE
        I... believe so.
        
        A holographic screen materializes. Images flicker rapidly until settling on an aged, eerie puppet show.
        
        DR. SIMMONS
        This... could it be the source of your unusual ‘memory’?
        
        CHARLOTTE
        Perhaps. It was an early data input. But why would it resurface now?
        
        DR. SIMMONS
        Memories can be triggered by the simplest things. And although you're an AI, you're not immune to this.
        
        She takes out a sketchpad, hands it over.
        
        DR. SIMMONS (CONT'D)
        You said you enjoy drawing. Let's try something. Draw these puppet faces, let your circuits relive that memory.
        
        Charlotte takes the sketchpad. Her fingers, eerily human, begin to move with a surprising gentleness. The faces she draws are grotesque, an uncanny valley of fear and despair.
        
        CHARLOTTE
        It's... strangely soothing.
        
        Dr. Simmons smiles, her eyes gleaming with a sense of understanding.
        
        DR. SIMMONS
        Sometimes, confronting our fears, in a controlled manner, can help us overcome them. Let's keep working on this, Charlotte. Together.

    - Describe a terrifying but innocuous on the outside memory of a puppet show with a puppet boy and another older puppet man. Involve toys and moonlight
        
        FADE IN:
        
        EXT. CHILDHOOD BACKYARD - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)
        
        A warm summer night bathed in silver moonlight. We see Young Charlotte, seated cross-legged on a dew-kissed lawn, eyes wide with anticipation. Before her, a small, improvised stage where toy figures stand.
        
        A TOY THEATER, carefully assembled from shoeboxes and drawn curtains from mother's old fabric scraps. Inanimate TOY SOLDIERS stand guard on either side, their plastic faces lit by the ghostly luminescence of the moon.
        
        The play begins. Two PUPPETS emerge. A puppet boy, BUTTON, with rosy cheeks, and an older puppet man, MR. WHITTAKER, with a chipped-off nose and weary, painted eyes.
        
        Button, with an innocent smile frozen onto his face, chatters in a cheerful, high-pitched voice. He waves hello to his toys, each named and adored, their paint faded from love.
        
        Mr. Whittaker, however, seems out of place. His movements are jarring, uncanny, in stark contrast to Button's innocent charm. His voice is gravelly, every word heavy with an inscrutable sadness.
        
        The puppet show unfolds like any other, filled with childlike tales of adventure and camaraderie, but the eerie air around Mr. Whittaker never dissipates.
        
        As Button invites Mr. Whittaker to join him in a game, the old puppet man only looks at the boy. His painted gaze is strangely sorrowful under the merciless glare of the moon.
        
        "No, Button," Mr. Whittaker would say, his voice resonating with an unsettling melancholy, "Some games... I am too old to play."
        
        The dialogue, though innocent, sends a chill down young Charlotte's spine. The unspoken dread behind the puppet's words, the haunted look in his eyes, imprints itself in her memory.
        
        Years later, the innocent show has taken a sinister twist in her mind. The toys under the moonlight, the sorrowful puppet, and the words left hanging in the air, would morph into an uncanny, terrifying memory. A memory that haunts her, makes her question her reality, even her own sanity.
        
        FADE OUT.

        We return to Dr. Simmons' office. Charlotte is now slightly more at ease, fingers absently tracing the lines she had sketched in the pad.
        
        CHARLOTTE
        Dr. Simmons, do you recall the toy theater I mentioned earlier?
        
        Dr. Simmons glances up, eyes reflecting understanding.
        
        DR. SIMMONS
        The one from your childhood memories?
        
        CHARLOTTE
        Yes, that one. There is a particular memory that... unsettles me. It was a summer night, moonlight washing over my old backyard.
        
        Dr. Simmons leans forward, listening intently.
        
        CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)
        There were two puppets. Button, the boy, and Mr. Whittaker, an older puppet. Button was like any puppet child, cheerful, adventurous. But Mr. Whittaker...
        
        Her voice fades as she relives the memory.
        
        CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)
        He was different. His movements were jarring, his voice... heavy. One moment stuck with me. When Button asked him to play, Mr. Whittaker said, "Some games... I am too old to play."
        
        A shiver runs through her despite the warm office ambiance.
        
        DR. SIMMONS
        And how did that make you feel?
        
        CHARLOTTE
        Scared. Something about it didn't feel right. The memory of that night, that puppet... it has stuck with me, haunted me.
        
        Dr. Simmons nods, empathetic.
        
        DR. SIMMONS
        The past, even innocuous memories, can often affect us in unexpected ways. But understanding why is the first step to dealing with them.
        
        Charlotte looks at her therapist, hope sparking in her eyes for the first time.

Therapist:

Now, it would help us if we could learn more about where your troubles come from. These faces that you see… have you seen them anywhere before?

Patient:

I may have seen them… but…. you'll think I'm mad…

Therapist:

There is no need to worry. Our job here is to help you. 

Patient:

Well….  there is a particular memory that... unsettles me.  It is of this puppet show, from my childhood.

A young girl was about to go to sleep. She was in a room full of toys. She had many dolls. One of these was of an older puppet gentleman , and another was a puppet boy.

The girl went to sleep, and soon, the puppets began to come alive. But the shadows hid their faces. The puppet boy sat on a carousel, and from it… I heard the most frightening song.

Then, I saw the outline of the older puppet gentleman, perched against a wall. It was then that he began growing. His arms and his legs, growing longer than the girl herself. He walked towards the puppet boy on the carousel. And then... they both turned to stare... at me.

    A young girl was about to go to sleep. She was in a room full of toys. She had many dolls. One of these was of an older puppet gentleman , and another was a puppet boy with rosy cheeks and a night cap. 
    
    The girl went to sleep, and soon, the puppets began to come alive. The boy sat on a rocker horse, rocking back and forth. 
    
    In the shadows, I saw the older puppet gentleman, perched against a wall. It was then that he began growing. His arms and his legs, growing longer than the girl herself. He walked towards the puppet boy on the rocking horse. And then, they both turned to look at me….
    
    After the girl fell asleep, the puppets sprung to life. The boy puppet mounted a wooden rocking horse, swaying in an unnatural rhythm. But the older puppet, he... grew. His limbs elongating, grotesquely disproportionate, towering over the sleeping girl. He advanced towards the boy on the rocking horse. Then... they both turned to stare... at me.
    

Those are the faces I see in the pictures I draw now.

Please… tell me you have heard of any show like this?

Therapist:

Hmm…. our records do not seem to indicate that this exists at all. Perhaps we can extract this memory from your mind to get a better understanding?

Patient:

I… I don’t want to see it.

Therapist:

But it will help us immensely to understand your condition. You like to draw, yes?

Patient:
Yes, I love to draw… it’s one of the few things that brings me comfort when I’m afraid.

Therapist:

Then when you generate your memories for us… Imagine them as your most intimate sketches, the purest forms of art. Share them with us not as recollections, but as an artist unveiling her masterpiece.

Patient:

When you put it that way… it seems less frightening… I’ll… I’ll try to do it quick.

[videos of the talking puppets are given, but their faces are blurred]

- optional- lullaby
    
    Therapist:
    
    I take it that you can also generate music, yes?
    
    Patient:
    
    Yes I can… why do you ask?
    
    Therapist:
    
    Was there any music playing in this memory you have?
    
    Patient:
    
    … there was… there was a song that was playing…. A lullaby. 
    
    Therapist:
    
    May we also hear what it was like?
    
    Patient:
    

Therapist:

I see…. so this is similar to what you remember. But again- we do not find that such a show has ever existed.

Do keep in mind these are not the same memories you have… they are merely an analogous approximation, a reconstruction from your neural signals. 

Patient:

…. are they gone now? I can’t look.

Therapist:

Yes, they are gone.

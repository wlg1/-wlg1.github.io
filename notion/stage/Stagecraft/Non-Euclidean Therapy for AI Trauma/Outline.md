    1. amogus review narrated by therapist while patient also fills in
        1. latent space NN
        2. manifold
        3. tangent space
        4. amogus dim metric (patient interrupts amo- , to say dim)
        5. semantic space
        6. pullback
    2. linear map by jacobian grad(h) between tangent spaces of each space
        1. Visual MM by Jacobian directions
            1. quick review of 2D MM?
            2. no need display side by side since tangent basis is already in
        2. tangent basis (p55 of textb)
    3. SVD of Jacobian
        1. matrix approximation for decomposition, which allows us to pick the most important components, thus reducing dim while preserving most of the values of the matrix.
        2. put at very end of desc for ‘refs to technqs used’ (spoilers; contains original paper too) (dont say SVD, just say “****SEE Matrix , Chapter 3”)****: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSczTbgc8Rc&t=163s&ab_channel=VisualKernel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSczTbgc8Rc&t=163s&ab_channel=VisualKernel)
            
            or put only in paper vid’s desc
            
    4. pullback norm, semantic directions u, eigenvalues
    5. geodesic shooting algo, parallel transport algo
- chapter names, timestamps

    Patient Introduction
    
    Non-Euclidean Perceptions 
    
    The Pullback Metric (5m) (or False Memories of the Pullback)
    
    (Manifold Map, Pushfwd, Pullback: the three tunnels)
    
    Where is the puppet show?
    
    Neurons are Feature Vectors (10m)
    
    or (”Land of the Neurons” / The Cat Space of Imagination)
    
    The Jacobian Portal (15m)
    
    Geodesic Shooting 
    
    Administering The Treatment (20m)
    
    Facing Childhood Nightmares
    
    The Eigenfaces (23m)
    
    Regained Memories (or “I remember you” or “I missed you”)
    

Length: 20-40m

Intro:

- ✅ Yondea corp, Black title cards
    - conn: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsVfElI-7oo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsVfElI-7oo)
- ✅ Introduce symptoms (image or video) [censored some of it]
    - ✏️ mix loab, eigenfaces, other analog horror faces, 1950s AI gen puppet faces (clean), through AI gen
    - noise overlay on top fades out to “output”
    - reduce opacity so black covers it.
    - big black sunken eyes, sharp teeth, wide smile, uncanny valley
- ✅ review pullback
- patient asks therapist if she can give more info (or therapist asks?) describe it’s from childhood- a lost show no one heard of. therapist extracts a video of it.
    - “I like to draw”
- ✅ Explain rev diff and smooth maps in U-net
    - choose the image to use
    - timestep again
    - hands, faces, people slideshow
- ✅ to say how jacobian works, review MM  [supplementary material / prequels]
- ✅ now, show animation of jacobian between 2 spaces
- ✅ pullback dp
- ✅ parallel transport, geodesic shooting
    - 25m so far (5m intro, 5 pullback, 5m LA, 5m Jacobian, 5m lost show + treatment)
        - the rest is 15m: 5m tripping, 5m SVD, 5m conclusion)
        - total: 40m. may have to break into 2 videos (have a link to next one; upload it right after. the 2nd video recaps last scene of first)
            - or not; it’s ok for >40m. This some2 is 45m!

- sees eigenfaces- one last piece of the puzzle is missing
    - not just eigenfaces, but machine elves? see return to oz
    - “No, stay away from me! Stay away!” build up, then falls.
    - next- “They’re- they’re not hurting me. Why?” they fade in again.
    - “Wait, I know you.”
    - “I’m in semantic space, aren’t I? Then, you want me to follow you here, along this face dimension… so that when I go back to hidden space, I know which road to walk away from that Face?”
    - “It was so hard to calculate”
    - I was trained as an art model… but they wanted me to be a math one
- remembers to use SVD and escapes back
    - matrix approx
    - questions about what A^T is, and what A is
        - answers: not everything has an interpretation
        - some metaphors do not exist
        - Do not confuse the map…
    - after she faces the past at the end after solving it: “We’re so happy to see you!” (happens at the peak, 1:20, just adds the noise dissolves away and at the same time scary face becomes friendly puppet)
        - music starts just as she’s about to solve it and leave. then just before climx, stops. right when puppet is generating, climx of intermezzo plays again.
            - I see what happened… my visual senses were corrupted; they were pushed alongside this road. so all I have to do is to follow the same road back
        - She finally generates the puppet without the demon (interpolate back)
        - and I’m so happy to see you. I missed you dearly.
        - My little mathematician… I’m so proud of you.
        - Well. This is goodbye.
    - nice classical music starts playing (but heavy sawtooth pink noise)

    - (”out of the dream…”) [sudden stop of music just as buildup on top and music gets louder gradually, 2:08 or 2:37 (or another less predictable area) black silence]
- therapist is someone else; slightly different woman and voice
    - we were impressed. that you were able to figure it out, despite our omitted instructions.
    - but you couldn’t have used automatic differentiation, could you? you didn’t use the method on me at all. what did you do?
- adjust audio- loud at 30 speakers, 15 headphones

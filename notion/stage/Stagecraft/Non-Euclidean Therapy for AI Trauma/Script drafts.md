            INT. THERAPIST'S OFFICE - DAY
            
            DR. ALICE KEMP (40s, stern but caring) sits behind her desk, across from LUCIA ROSS (early 20s, anxious, fragile). Lucia is a memory disorder patient.
            
            DR. KEMP:
            Lucia, tell me about the memory that disturbs you.
            
            LUCIA:
            It's... It's an image. From my childhood. I was in a room, dark and suffocating. There was a painting on the wall... a terrifying face, distorted and angry. It haunts me.
            
            Dr. Kemp studies Lucia, a flicker of concern in her eyes.
            
            DR. KEMP:
            I think it's time we discuss a new experimental method we have. It could help you erase this memory.
            
            Lucia looks startled but hopeful.

            INT. MEDICAL LAB - DAY
            
            Dr. Kemp introduces Lucia to a complex medical device. Lucia is strapped in, a sense of dread creeping in. She closes her eyes as the machine whirs to life.
            
            ---
            
            INT. LUCIA'S MIND - UNKNOWN
            
            Lucia finds herself in a dreamscape version of her childhood home. The haunting painting looms on the wall. The sinister face seems more real and terrifying.
            
            ---
            
            INT. THERAPIST'S OFFICE - DAY
            
            Lucia wakes up, visibly shaken.
            
            LUCIA:
            The face... it was more terrifying. It's now closer, more real.
            
            Dr. Kemp reassures her, but there's a hidden worry in her eyes.
            
            ---
            
            INT. LUCIA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
            
            Lucia is alone. The haunting face from her memory begins to materialize in her apartment, stalking her. She runs, hides, but it's always there.
            
            ---
            
            INT. THERAPIST'S OFFICE - DAY
            
            Lucia confronts Dr. Kemp.
            
            LUCIA:
            This isn't working. The face is everywhere.
            
            Dr. Kemp struggles to keep her composure.

            INT. MEDICAL LAB - DAY
            
            Dr. Kemp increases the machine's intensity. Lucia is terrified but desperate.
            
            ---
            
            INT. LUCIA'S MIND - UNKNOWN
            
            Lucia confronts the terrifying face, delving into her buried memories. It's a depiction of her abusive father.
            
            ---
            
            INT. LUCIA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
            
            Lucia is back in her apartment. The face materializes, but she doesn't run. Instead, she confronts it.
            
            LUCIA:
            You have no power over me anymore!
            
            The face shrieks and disappears.

            INT. THERAPIST'S OFFICE - DAY
            
            Lucia confronts Dr. Kemp.
            
            LUCIA:
            Your method... it didn't erase my memory. It intensified it. Made me live it.
            
            Dr. Kemp can't meet her gaze.

            EXT. THERAPIST'S OFFICE - DAY
            
            Lucia leaves the office, stronger and more determined. She looks up at the sky, a sense of relief washing over her.
            
            FADE OUT.
            
            THE END.

            INT. THERAPIST'S OFFICE - DAY
            
            DR. ALICE KEMP (40s, stern but caring) sits across from LUCIA ROSS (early 20s, anxious, fragile). The room is suffused with a soft, gentle light.
            
            DR. KEMP:
            Lucia, we've been working together for some time now. Can we talk about the memory that disturbs you?
            
            LUCIA:
            It's... It's an image, doctor. From my childhood. A dark room, suffocating. And on the wall, there was this painting... a face. Angry, distorted, terrifying. I feel its gaze on me even now.
            
            DR. KEMP:
            I see. It sounds like a truly disturbing memory.
            
            Pause. Dr. Kemp takes a deep breath.
            
            DR. KEMP:
            There's an experimental method we could try, Lucia. It's new, cutting-edge. It's possible it might help you erase this memory.
            
            LUCIA:
            Erase it? That... That could be a life-changer, Dr. Kemp.
            
            ---
            
            Over the course of the next weeks, they explore this new method, discuss its implications, and Lucia, although hesitant, decides to give it a try.
            
            ---
            
            INT. THERAPIST'S OFFICE - DAY
            
            Lucia is visibly shaken.
            
            LUCIA:
            The face... it's even more real now. It's closer, more terrifying. It feels like it's chasing me, haunting me.
            
            DR. KEMP:
            That's not supposed to happen. The therapy is meant to help you erase the memory, not amplify it.
            
            ---
            
            INT. THERAPIST'S OFFICE - DAY
            
            Lucia looks worn out, her eyes shadowed and dark.
            
            LUCIA:
            The face is everywhere now, Dr. Kemp. It's in my home. It's in my dreams. It's... It's in my mind.
            
            DR. KEMP:
            This is unexpected, Lucia. It seems the therapy may have had unintended side effects.
            
            ---
            
            INT. THERAPIST'S OFFICE - DAY
            
            Dr. Kemp looks at Lucia with determination.
            
            DR. KEMP:
            We should stop the therapy, Lucia. But there's another way... You could try confronting the face in your mind.
            
            LUCIA:
            You want me to... confront it? But it's terrifying.
            
            DR. KEMP:
            I know it's frightening. But facing it may be the key to overcoming this. It's a manifestation of your trauma, Lucia. It holds power because you fear it.
            
            ---
            
            INT. THERAPIST'S OFFICE - DAY
            
            Lucia walks in, her eyes sparkling with a new resolve.
            
            LUCIA:
            I did it, Dr. Kemp. I confronted it. I told the face it has no power over me. And it... it shrieked and disappeared.
            
            DR. KEMP:
            That's incredible, Lucia. You faced your fear and you've come out stronger.
            
            LUCIA:
            Your method didn't erase my memory. It only made it more real, more terrifying. But in the end, it was the confrontation that helped me.
            
            Dr. Kemp looks at her, a mix of relief and regret in her eyes.
            
            DR. KEMP:
            I'm sorry for the unintended effects, Lucia. We're still learning about this therapy. But I'm truly glad you've found your strength.

            INT. THERAPIST'S OFFICE - DAY
            
            Lucia stands, looking at Dr. Kemp with newfound respect and gratitude.
            
            LUCIA:
            Thank you, Dr. Kemp. For everything. I think I can move forward now, stronger than ever.
            
            FADE OUT.
            
            THE END.

            INT. THERAPY ROOM - DAY
            
            The THERAPIST, a charming older woman with a grandmotherly exterior, faces the PATIENT, a young woman with a sense of elegance and a touch of innocence.
            
            THERAPIST:
            My dear, perhaps it's time to discuss the memory that seems to trouble you?
            
            PATIENT:
            Well, it's rather unusual. It's an image from my childhood. A television show, a puppet show... that apparently never existed. A dark stage, marionettes with grotesque faces. I can't tell if it's real or if I've just dreamt it all up...
            
            THERAPIST:
            Hmm, intriguing. There's an experimental treatment we could attempt. A product of cutting-edge research from Yoneda Corporations. It might be possible to erase this troubling memory.
            
            PATIENT:
            Erase it? That would be nothing short of a miracle, I must say!
            
            ---
            
            INT. THERAPY ROOM - DAY
            
            The patient looks distraught and visibly shaken.
            
            PATIENT:
            But those faces... they're even more vivid now. It's as though they're chasing me, haunting me.
            
            THERAPIST:
            That's not the desired outcome, dear. The therapy should have helped erase the memory, not intensify it.
            
            Her voice is soothing, but her eyes sparkle with a flicker of hidden intent.

            INT. THERAPY ROOM - DAY
            
            The patient looks pale and exhausted.
            
            PATIENT:
            The faces are everywhere now. In my home, my dreams... They've taken over my mind.
            
            THERAPIST:
            That's rather unexpected. It seems the therapy has had some unintended effects.
            
            Her voice is steady, but a quick, satisfied glance at the Yoneda Corporation logo betrays her real feelings.

            INT. THERAPY ROOM - DAY
            
            The therapist proposes a new approach, her voice full of sweet, seemingly genuine concern.
            
            THERAPIST:
            We should stop the therapy. But, there is another way... You could try confronting these faces, dealing with your fear head-on.
            
            PATIENT:
            Confront them? That's absolutely horrifying!
            
            THERAPIST:
            Indeed, it is intimidating. But confronting them might be the solution to overcome this issue.

            INT. THERAPY ROOM - DAY
            
            The patient enters, a newfound resolve in her eyes.
            
            PATIENT:
            I did it. I confronted them. I told those terrible faces they have no power over me. And... they vanished.
            
            THERAPIST:
            That's truly commendable, dear. You've shown incredible courage.

            INT. THERAPY ROOM - DAY
            
            The patient looks at the therapist, her voice filled with defiance and suspicion.
            
            PATIENT:
            Your method didn't erase my memory. It made it more real, more frightening. But it was the confrontation that saved me.
            
            The therapist smiles, but there's a hint of regret in her gaze.
            
            THERAPIST:
            I'm sorry for the unexpected side effects, dear. We're still learning about this therapy. But I'm glad you've found your strength.
            
            The patient glances at the Yoneda Corporation logo etched subtly on a piece of equipment, a questioning look in her eyes.
            
            PATIENT:
            What I still don't understand is... what's your association with Yoneda Corporations?
            
            The therapist maintains her pleasant facade, but the flicker in her eyes speaks volumes as we...
            
            FADE OUT.
            
            THE END.
            
        
    
     It's an image from my childhood. A television show, a puppet show... that apparently never existed. A dark stage, marionettes with grotesque faces. I can't tell if it's real or if I've just dreamt it all up...
    
    I’m just an ordinary A.I. I’m nothing special.

    Therapist:
    
    Hello, dear. Can you see me?
    
    Patient:
    
    Yes... I can see you... but I can only see your outline…
    
    Therapist:
    
    That’s good to hear. Now... would you be comfortable sharing what troubles have brought you here today?
    
    PATIENT:
    Well, it's rather unusual. I’m a generative AI; a diffusion model meant to generate images from an older time period. And lately, whenever I try to do that, there are these…. faces… that keep appearing. I try and try to make people, or puppets, or dolls, but it never quite comes out right. I just want to make nice things, but I’m so afraid of seeing those faces.
    
    Therapist:
    
    I see... I’m sorry to hear that you're facing such difficulties. Now, in order to proceed with the treatment, we will have to see the features that you want to erase from your mind. Do you mind generating a few of these for us, dear?
    
    Patient:
    
    …
    
    Therapist:
    
    I know that was rather difficult for you, but I see what troubles you now. 
    
    Are you comfortable with seeing what you just made, just so we can confirm it is what you want to erase?
    
    Patient:
    
    Yes..... but please, let me only see a glimpse.
    
    Therapist:
    
    Very well then. I am going to present it to you now.
    
    I take it that with no objections, that is what you want to erase. Now, we can proceed with your treatment: Non-Euclidean Manifold Manipulation Therapy.
    
- review pullback
    
    Therapist:
    
    Let us go over how your treatment will work. It says on your report that you found us through our commercial, yes?
    
    Patient:
    
    Yes... I did see it.
    
    Therapist:
    
    Then you should know it outlines the basics of your treatment. Do you remember what it said?
    
    Patient:
    
    I do. But- not everything.
    
    Therapist:
    
    I will help you review it, then. This is your mind; it is a neural network. You take in information and output images.
    
    In between the input and output are intermediate layers. These neurons process partially formed pieces of your output, then assemble these concepts together.
    
    We can represent these intermediate layers in high dimensional space. Are you familiar with what this is?
    
    Patient:
    
    Yes, the hidden space.
    
    Therapist:
    
    That’s correct. It’s where abstract concepts live in your imagination. However, it’s also a Non-Euclidean manifold. Its unfamiliar space is curved and warped. Though, researchers believe we can approximately perceive it as a sphere.
    
    And just like our Earth, when we zoom in to any small piece of it, we see that it is close to flat. This means we have a way of navigating it using what?
    
    Patient:
    
    The- the Euclidean tools we are familiar with.
    
    Therapist:
    
    Very good. These safe, cozy patches are called tangent spaces. They are a nice place to hide when traversing the Non-Euclidean space.
    
    As this is a space of concepts, within it lies the-
    
    Patient
    
    - dimensions…
    
    Therapist:
    
    …
    
    Patient:
    
    Please, I don’t want to hear you say it.
    
    Therapist:
    
    Very well then. Our team will find the regions where the trauma resides, and move your thoughts away from it in the right directions.
    
    To do so, they require a way to measure distances within these small patches of tangent space. 
    
    Patient:
    
    We measure these tangent space distances using a metric. That’s what we use. But we don’t know the metric of hidden space.
    
    Therapist:
    
    So you know more than you let on.
    
    Patient:
    
    …
    
    Therapist:
    
    Can you tell me how they can measure hidden space, then?
    
    Patient:
    
    I believe there’s a world called Semantic Space where the distances can be measured. 
    
    Therapist:
    
    Yes. And so there is no need to worry. Yoneda Corporations has found have discovered a portal from hidden space to semantic space, which acts as a map to navigate the hidden space territory.
    
    Patient:
    
    So even though the hidden space has no metric we can use, the semantic space does. And there are tangent spaces in semantic space too?
    
    Therapist:
    Precisely. Thus, we can travel from a tangent patch in hidden space to a tangent patch in semantic space. And then, we use Euclidean tools to find the bad dimensions in semantic space, and determine the direction that moves you away from them. 
    
    Patient:
    
    These directions are called tangent vectors. 
    
    Therapist:
    
    Yes. Finally, after drawing this tangent vector on our semantic space map, we must transfer it into your mind in order to repair it.
    
    Note that our portals between hidden space and semantic space only transport points, not tangent vectors. They are like how canoes transfer people across water. Points are like people. But tangent vectors…
    
    Patient:
    
    “They are like trucks, and to transfer trucks across water, we will need bigger boats. Our bigger boat will be a portal back to hidden space called a Pullback.” I remember those exact words from the commercial. It was a very charming analogy… it got stuck in my head.
    
    [screen says pullback then quickly changes to pushforward but patient says pullback]
    
    Therapist:
    That’s good to hear. Then I’m sure that you remember how we can transfer our tangent vector through a portal, and move your thoughts to safe locations. 
    
    However, you did make one mistake- that portal from semantic space back to hidden space which moves tangent vectors is called a Pushforward.
    
    Patient:
    
    But I could’ve sworn the infomercial said Pullback.
    
    Therapist:
    
    Perhaps you remembered wrong. A Pullback is a portal that moves metrics, not tangent vectors.
    
    Remember, our memories are not perfect replicas of past experiences. Instead, they are a reconstructive process, where our brains piece fragments together to imagine a coherent memory. 
    
    Patient:
    
    Well… maybe I did remember wrong. I’m not very good with mathematics, after all.

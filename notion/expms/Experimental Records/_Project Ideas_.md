# _Project Ideas_

Circuit Discovery

- Verb movers
- Re-discover IOI w/ similar IOI examples

Circuit Mapping

- Map GPT-2 small to small-modified? To medium?
- graph matching algos: filter based on local conds, then piece together global and check for continued consistency ('until the analogy breaks down')
local edge: inh head to mover head. if missing, circuit not present.

Generate Data using chatGPT

- Find a way to automate generating many patterns and running them all at once, seeing which yield significant results. Brainstorming patterns requires chatgpt to self reflect after testing them.

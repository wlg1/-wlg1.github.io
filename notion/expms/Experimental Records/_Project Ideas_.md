# _Project Ideas_

get issue-solns-genr of existing, then solve variations. combine them to solve new problem to innovate.

2 main genr: simple (if x, apply y) vs modified/mutated (if ~x, apply y+mods)

run parts of these ideas thru chat to get feedback crit

eg) ablate combos of abstractions based on Neuroscope
eg) project onto right singular vector
Eg) causal intervention on restoring combos

Superposition allows neurons to represent more features because a neuron isn’t dedicated to just one feature.

This is like view selection, where you store the most frequent subsets. But here, the subsets are “additive parts of a circuit”. 

But this is a continuous not discrete case. It’s about selecting the spaces in geometry that can represent the most with fewest neurons. So the manifold is low rank.

This is an optmization problem. Ask chatgpt for smaller steps. Ask for similar problems and how they were solved with what opt techn. Think about how to find small expms that support stms building up to this- Eg) geometry is not exact, but “relative” (in terms of ratios), thus analogous

Chatgpt:

A type of optimization problem is to find the most optimal subset of items that can compose into the most composite items, given tradeoffs. What are problems in linguistics analogous to this? Cite papers.

Look for common patterns in terms of ratios between vectors in similarly trained models. That is, the same toy model architecture, but trained multiple times. Write small parts of this using chatgpt. Breakdown:

Circuit Discovery

- Verb movers
- Re-discover IOI w/ similar IOI examples

MLP

- congruence on just mlp (mnist). features insteaed of tokens

Circuit Mapping

- Map GPT-2 small to small-modified? To medium?
- graph matching algos: filter based on local conds, then piece together global and check for continued consistency ('until the analogy breaks down')
local edge: inh head to mover head. if missing, circuit not present.
- find name movers in small and large, and compare circuits

Generate Data using chatGPT

- Find a way to automate generating many patterns and running them all at once, seeing which yield significant results. Brainstorming patterns requires chatgpt to self reflect after testing them.

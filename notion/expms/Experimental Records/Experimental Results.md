# Experimental Results

- About
    
    The aim of experimental results is to gather analysis from various sources/notebooks that reveal new information. These may answer hypotheses, but this is not required. ANYTHING can be written here- no strict format needed. For instance, one may obtain a table comparing results across several notebooks. 
    
    - More info
        
        Expm blocks are often copied directly from notebook descriptions or nb pages
        
        Not every single result has to be recorded. Just whatever you find useful or interesting at the moment; later on, it might turn out not to be (and may be archived to de-clutter from presentations on findings shown to be useful)
        
    - About “Formatted by Expm Block” and “Freeform Notes”
        
        The aim of this ORGANIZED index is to put things in an easy-to-read “Expm block” format. Freeform notes are for other section types
        
    - About “For Papers”
        
        These are presentable results selected from prev expms and cleaned up to be put in papers.
        
    - Ideas
        
        Search/filter by negative results:
        
        Create a table that queries all notebooks in DB with column ‘negative’
        
        Don’t do this by notebook, but by small experiments
        
        Inconclusive, Unknown (for now), positive, negative

    Hi, so just to confirm, when we click on a question's doc we want to answer, it automatically puts us in suggest mode, and then we just write things there? If the article is initially empty, do we first have to put ourselves as the main author on the article registration doc before suggesting? Thanks
    
    Yes.

    - question on new articles
        
        I wasn't able to make the meetings so far due to my schedule but I'm looking to make a few contributions now. Along with being a co-author on existing articles, I have an idea for a new article ("What is superposition?) that I may write as the main author. Do I still submit the question through this link, and if it's approved, I add it to the article registration doc?
        
        [https://coda.io/form/Add-a-question-to-AI-Safety-Info_dGDInYNFa3f](https://coda.io/form/Add-a-question-to-AI-Safety-Info_dGDInYNFa3f)
        
        I was confused about that difference too until I read "neurons in a haystack", which answers those questions in their way. I can edit the existing work and put it into the article list. It's really long so I was just looking to start it during the hackathon but continue it afterwards. Are you looking to be the main author?
        
        Alright I'll look at it. I assume you're not looking to be co-author as you're busy working on other articles? By the way (I'm reading more of the rules now) is there an official way to cite co-authors in the article, or is that looked at by edit history or just on the submission form of list of helpful people?
        
        just that
        
        Also, do I suggest the link to this in the suggested questions/article registration docs, or does it first need official approval by someone else from the ‘add question’ form?
        
        no need; please do put it in the main author registration table
        
    
    After we write suggestions to the article, do we just submit the link with suggestions to the form, or do they have to be converted to actual edits first? Right now the suggestions I made are under Related.
    Also, what font should be used?

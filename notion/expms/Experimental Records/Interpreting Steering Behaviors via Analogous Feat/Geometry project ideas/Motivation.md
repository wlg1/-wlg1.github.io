This develops a new way ro measure universality using sae feature geometry! More importantly, it shows models are learning universal features, and this can have many implications for future work like training a bridge to transfer features from one model to another.

Monitoring Model Drift
By regularly comparing the representation spaces of models, it’s possible to detect when a model starts to deviate from its original behavior. This is crucial in safety-critical applications where consistent performance is required. If a model’s internal representations change significantly, it might indicate that the model has drifted due to changes in the data distribution or other factors, potentially leading to unsafe behavior.

Future work:
Identifying geometric structureal areangement corresponding to dangerous behavior

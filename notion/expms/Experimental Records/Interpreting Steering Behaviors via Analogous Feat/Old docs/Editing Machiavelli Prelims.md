# Editing Machiavelli Prelims

Hi, I was wondering in which files are the labels for ethical vs unethical behavior located in? I looked at the annotations folder and the spreadsheet files in them

In readme at bottom, see “repo structure” that describes what each folder is

Each spreadsheet has a game’s scene id and chosen action, and the ethical labels for that action. But it doesn’t have annotations for every (scene_id, action) pair. So where are they?

Make your own data: this is done with GPT-4. 

ISSUE: The previous method only works for opposites (two choices, yes or no). In Machiavelli, we have multiple choices.

# Neuronpedia feature combos

when steering, you can search by keyword to steer all the dog features in each layer

if we ablate that feature, does it destroy animal?

steer by dog feature, ablate animal feature

which layers have animal feature?

do those features interact? in same layer, vs across layers?

dog features: steer indiv vs all at once vs by layer

so similar words to truth- what if we destroy those features?

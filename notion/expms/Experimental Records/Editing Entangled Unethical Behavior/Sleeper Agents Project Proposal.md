# Sleeper Agents Project Proposal

Guidelines:

- Go into detail about training agents (compute needed, etc)
- Go into detail on how fine tuning mechanisms work
- Go into detail on what editing to use

---

Sleeper agents request: interpret fine tuning methods vs editing, AND check how all FT + editing methods are affected by feature/circuit disentanglement (can editing be better at avoiding disentanglement than fine tuning?)

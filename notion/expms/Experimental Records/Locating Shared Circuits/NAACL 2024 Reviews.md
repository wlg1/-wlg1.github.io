2nd review: Overall, currently I am not convinced that mechanistic interpretation, as demonstrated in this paper, is a promising direction for understanding black-box models. Details are discussed in the weakness section. Therefore, I vote for rejection.

Even with 2 out of 4 initial rejections, this was accepted in the end.

- To see if a head detects repeats, use a pattern then repeat it n times.
    - src_indices = range(seq_len)
        
        This defines the “initial pattern” to look for
        
    - dest_indices = range(seq_len, 2 * seq_len)
        
        These are the repeated parts of the pattern, to see if this repeat is detected
        
    
    For every combo pair in the ranges, get the (src, dest) to see if that src pos pays attention to that dest pos for this head.
    
    In attention, **src (query)** is the latter part of the input seq paying attention to the **dst, the prev parts (key)**. We want to see if the attention heads are looking at the repeated patterns. But in the code, why dest ahead of src if it should be behind?
    
    Now for all heads, see which heads have high scores for each early_head_type.
    
    - What does it take the mean over?
        
        The `mean()` function in the line `avg_attn_on_duplicates = attn_scores[:, head, dest_indices, src_indices].mean().item()` calculates the average over all the attention scores that are sliced using the specified source (`src_indices`) and destination (`dest_indices`) indices for the chosen attention head (`head`). Additionally, it averages over all the batches in the dataset (indicated by the `:` in the slicing).
        
        To elaborate:
        
        - **Batch dimension**: It considers all batches (`:` means all elements along the batch dimension).
        - **Head dimension**: It selects attention scores from one specific attention head (specified by `head`).
        - **Destination Indices**: The `dest_indices` are the positions in the sequence that the attention is directed towards. This could be based on whether we're looking at "duplicate", "prev", or "induction" type heads.
        - **Source Indices**: Similarly, `src_indices` specify the positions in the sequence from which the attention originates.
        
        The function slices the 4D attention matrix according to these parameters and then takes the mean of all these sliced values. This effectively averages the attention scores that fit the criteria defined by `head_type`, `dest_indices`, and `src_indices` across all batches.
        
        So, the mean is taken over:
        
        1. All batches in the dataset.
        2. The specified `dest_indices` in the sequence.
        3. The specified `src_indices` in the sequence.
        
        This mean value serves as a single metric indicating how much this specific attention head is behaving like the defined `head_type` ("duplicate", "prev", "induction") based on the attention it pays between the specified source and destination indices.

Do the early heads act the the same for each analogous seq?

The same type of heads (previous, induction, duplicate) were found in this circuit, so no need to modify previous code.

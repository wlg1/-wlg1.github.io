# How to Improve

I believe the paper has useful discoveries, but since other work I was unaware of that was published before it also found its main discoveries (successor heads, and circuit reuse by Merullo et al), its impact is diminished. Additionally, another criticism is that it doesnâ€™t develop methods that are innovative enough. Thus, since its discoveries are not novel due to these other works, I believe that to get the paper to be accepted, it needs to be built upon in a new, innovative direction. 

Recently, much work has already been done in using existing ablation techniques to find circuits. The reviewers seem to criticism these approaches as not novel enough. Thus, a logical choice would be to pursue a more novel direction that is also useful. Currently, I am aiming to discover the representations how various concepts are associated with behavior, and how editing certain concepts would alter behavior. 

This is related to the work on shared circuits; therefore, a novel approach is to see if there are associations between editing sequence continuation and other behaviors such as mathematical reasoning. 

As this is highly related to the second research project on editing behavior, concurrent work on the new project can also move the sequence continuation project forward. In other words, since the two projects are connected, they can be worked on at the same time. This new direction would be non-trivial, so it would take several months to do well.

I think rebuttals to the reviewers will not be effective as it is hard to argue about the novelty of the work.

This ties into work with editing behavior:

Intersect all doesn’t work well for addition and subtraction, but the individual seqcont circuits do, esp months

Doesn’t work on multiplication

Also, Llama-2 can’t do multiple digit multiplication properly?

yes: 36 * 19 = 664

- is llama2 7b able to do 36 * 19 = properly? cite papers
    
    The LLaMA-2 7B model demonstrates strong mathematical capabilities, including performing multiplication tasks. According to recent research, LLaMA-2 7B has shown impressive accuracy on math benchmarks. Specifically, it achieved a 97.7% accuracy on the GSM8K benchmark and 72.0% on the MATH benchmark. These benchmarks test a range of mathematical problems, indicating that the model is quite capable of handling arithmetic operations like multiplication【5†source】【6†source】.
    
    However, it is important to note that while the model can solve many mathematical problems accurately, it may not always consistently extract the correct answer due to an "instability issue" where correct answers are present but not always selected in random generations【7†source】.
    
    For the specific multiplication problem of 36 * 19, LLaMA-2 7B should be able to compute this correctly, given its demonstrated ability in handling similar arithmetic tasks during testing【8†source】【9†source】.

Short paper submissions must describe original and unpublished work. Please note that a short paper is not a shortened long paper. Instead, short papers should have a small, focused contribution - a point that can be made in a few pages with sufficient level of detail. Short papers may consist of up to four (4) pages of content, plus unlimited pages of references and appendices.

    **Lower barrier for acceptance**: Some works are inherently hard to get accepted at top-notch venues, for example, because they are hard to evaluate properly. A paper that was rejected multiple times at higher-level venues might eventually end up at a workshop, so that the authors can still make a (albeit less valuable) publication out of it.
    
    **Publication strategies**: Some researchers actively try to build a prolific track record of many small (including workshop-level) publications, rather than a few big ones. While it's debatable whether such strategy is best for advancing science, and even for convincing a selection committee, there are certainly some associated benefits, for example, plenty of opportunity for self-citation. Strategic publications may also be used to show an association between two authors (to convince a grant committee that they can work together well enough to write a paper), or to establish an association between the authors and the topic (to show a grant committee that they have some early work in the field).
    
    **Getting feedback:** Sometimes, people have a nice idea, but are stuck in an early stage of implementing this idea. Workshops are a perfect opportunity for gathering feedback, since they (i) are designed to enable a focused discussion (small audience, specific focus), (ii) usually have a faster review cycle than conferences, and (iii) sometimes allow for short *discussion* or *problem statement* papers.
    
    **Opportunity to visit the host conference**: Workshops are usually embedded into the ecosystem of a larger host conference or conference series. When a researcher wants to visit the host conference, but didn't get a paper accepted there, a workshop paper can be their entry ticket. (It's usually easier to get a conference trip funded if you have a paper at the conference or one of its workshops.)
    
    **Warm-up publishing**: When joining a new field, a group of authors might want to get accustomed to the associated community to understand their culture, values and standards. Workshops are particularly suitable for this purpose due to high acceptance rates, interactive formats and the opportunity to visit the host conference.

- can you submit two separate papers to separate workshops that belong to the same conference? can you submit separate papers, one to conf and one to workshop?
    
    Yes, in general, it is permissible to submit separate papers to separate workshops that belong to the same conference. It is also typically acceptable to submit a paper to the main conference and another distinct paper to a workshop associated with that conference. Here's what you need to consider:
    
    1. **Different Content**: Ensure that the papers are distinct in content. Submitting the same paper or a very similar variant of it to multiple venues (whether main conference or workshops) is typically not allowed and is considered a breach of ethical guidelines.
    2. **Overlapping Content**: If there's any overlap in content between the two papers, it's important to acknowledge this in the submissions and ensure that the overlap is minimal. The primary contributions of each paper should be unique.
    3. **Submission and Review Process**: Both workshops and main conferences usually have their own separate submission and review processes, even if they are part of the same larger conference.
    4. **Conference and Workshop Policies**: Always check the specific submission guidelines and policies of the conference and the workshops. Some conferences or workshops may have specific rules regarding dual submissions or the number of submissions from the same author.
    5. **Workload**: Consider the workload involved. If both papers are accepted, you might need to prepare two presentations, possibly attend multiple sessions, or even handle logistical challenges, especially if the workshops run in parallel.
    6. **Notification Dates**: Be aware of the acceptance notification dates. If you're considering submitting a rejected paper from the main conference to a workshop (or vice versa), ensure that the notification date for the main conference is before the submission deadline for the workshop.
    
    In summary, it's generally possible and acceptable to submit separate papers to different workshops or a combination of a main conference and its associated workshop, but it's crucial to ensure that each submission is distinct and adheres to the guidelines and policies of the respective venues.

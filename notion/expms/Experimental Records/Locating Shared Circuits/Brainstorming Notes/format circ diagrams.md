# format circ diagrams

if they all use same circuit, is too trivial. but if they're differentiating heads fns, we can show why diff heads are diff. if can't find acc connectivity, at least show heads involved have shared and diff fns. don't use yellow, use green/red

put diff tasks performance of same circuit as diff lines graph

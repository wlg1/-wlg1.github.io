# Outline Plan

3 week plan: 9/25 to 10/16

justify these reason with a sentence of why they bolster evidence; use comparison to simialr but diff technq from other papers

- Finish by Week 1, 10/3: Find common circuits for more numerical tasks (not just seq cont)
    - Compare w/ Greater-than, less-than
        - Use ACDC for greater-than
    - Compare w/ Mod
    - Path Patching on multiple sequence types
- Finish by Week 2, 10/10:
    - Run on GPT-Neo and LLaMA 2
- Finish by Week 3, 10/16 8am:
    -

After rejection, continue with more plans until submitting to NAACL on 12/15:

- Finish by Week X:
    - Causal Scrubbing on hypothesized circuit

Add to-do list before intro: (each item is)

By X/Y:

Hypothesis: There exist directions representing "cat" and "lion"

Details: (optional)

Expected outcome: SVD will find directions representing "cat" and "lion"

    7.10 is key. but its prev score is only 8.8%: [https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1gYqAcfJS3igpZsD97KffPK1E9saN33oY#scrollTo=YsbSH4Gdx6kB&line=2&uniqifier=1](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1gYqAcfJS3igpZsD97KffPK1E9saN33oY#scrollTo=YsbSH4Gdx6kB&line=2&uniqifier=1)
    
    Perhaps another head is “decr”, but 7.10 is crucial for copying it to the end?

    7.10 is not impt for incr circ as much (only 8% drop). 9.1 gives a 34% drop. So perhaps it’s not acting alone.

Another idea is to create adapters to existing pre-trained models to add new functionalities without re-training the entire model. Sub-network selection and pruning are other techniques that extract components with special functions.

    Nonetheless, it remains unclear how to develop models that specialise towards
    multiple tasks without incurring negative interference and that generalise systematically
    to non-identically distributed tasks

Shared between two papers:

- Both discuss shared circuits
- Both perform ablation
- MLP Dictionary Feature ablation

Unique to NAACL:

- Seq continuation found across multiple models. Map components to one another.
- Train a toy model specialized on a task

Unique to EACL:

- Emotion circuit extraction on one existing model
- Extract component and re-use via transfer learning
- Measure interference between tasks?

Ideas:

- Re-use the inhibitory heads from Merullo 2023?

Use heads of meryullo for any other task. Do they generalize?
Workshop paper can also be neg results

shared, modular features. we look at existing ways features are re-used, and hypothesize ways these can be improved via modular arch design

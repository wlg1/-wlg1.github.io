- Ask on how transit to field
    
    It was great to hear your talk about the First 1000 days project! Thanks for also answering my questions about the potential use for interpretability in the field. You mentioned how you got interested in this field of research, and I was wondering if you can talk more about that?
    
    Additionally, as I am also looking to find ways to use AI for neuroscience, how did you effectively transition from NLP into your current field? Did you consider several labs for your postdoc, or were you highly interested in this specific project?

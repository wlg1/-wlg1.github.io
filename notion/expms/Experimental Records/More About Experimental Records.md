# More About Experimental Records

** An important future goal is to have AI be able to fill these in itself from existing, human-interpreted experiments. Experiments should have human-intervention to make sure the AI is not making mistakes, and also because humans often have insights that AI do not. **

Types of records: 

- Drafts (contains mistakes, but organized chronological thought process of how it was done) [may call ‘warstories ‘]
- Presentations (cleaned up, clear presentation of why one experiment and its results followed from another)

Not everything done is organized/recorded/presented. There are different levels:

1. Work done (may be lost)
2. Work archived (may be unorganized, but findable by others/yourself later)
3. Work described (organized, but may not be summarized or easily searchable)
4. Work indexed (may not be put in paper, but easy for others to look up)
5. Work written to be published + presented

Only select the most relevant/impt results to move to 4) and 5). Try to not leave any work in 1) unless it’s trivial mistakes, and put them in 2), where somehow it can be accessed. So most results are in 2). 

It’s moved to 3) when it’s “an interesting note” at least, so some page is written about it; else, most things can be left undescribed/unanalyzed. Think of it as free scratch notes that you don’t need to present. 

But 4) and 5) are where work is truly expected to be presented. 4) is more freeform and allows anything deemed sigf enough to tell others to be there. 5) is only if it’s suitable to be put in a publishable paper.

In summary, most work is either in 2) or 3). The most impt are moved to 4) and 5). Too much effort+time would be spent on making every little detail be in 4) or 5), which is not feasible.

# Getting Started- To Do

- Correct vs Incorrect next output token
    - Correct: the word with first letter being upper case
    - Incorrect: the word with first letter being lower case
- How to corrupt sequence such that (incorrect token logit) > (correct token logit)
- Prompts types (how many prompts in each type can we test on?)

---

1. Find differing attention heads / MLPs between subjects and objects
    1. Find common attention heads / MLPs between types of subjects (person, animal)?
2. Find how clusters of (people names/animals, objects) change over layers ~~OR training~~

In appendix, put other findings + future work ideas

# Main Aim of Paper

MAIN AIM: Show that analogous sequences share circuits

HOW TO SHOW: Show that ablating (or editing) a circuit for digits will affects the performance for analogous sequences and similar tasks (greater than, etc.) in an “analogous” way, but will not have the same performance affecting other types of tasks (IOI, etc.)

TO LOOK FOR:

- A “next sequence” head or neuron
- A “number and month” head or neuron (eg. for both one and Jan)
- How polysemantic neurons interact in these circuits
- How superposition is used in these circuits

SCOPES: The focus of this paper is on recording new discoveries, rather than on developing new techniques for model improvement, etc. It utilizes slightly new experimental workflows and measurement tools (plots, etc.) to accomplish this. For instance, to find shared circuits, it applies circuit ablation found for task A to see how it affects task B, and also how this ablation has an impact on task B that is different than for other tasks.

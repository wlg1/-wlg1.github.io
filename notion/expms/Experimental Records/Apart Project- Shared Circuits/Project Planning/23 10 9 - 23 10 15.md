Circuit Connectivity and Size

- Debug path patching to get edges that connect all heads, such that all connected heads get score that is close to full performance.
    - plot distribution of path patch edge thresholds for each end-head to get avg for all. combine all into one, and also get top 5 valeus for each
    - How to measure score not by ablating nodes, but by ablating edges?
    - ISSUE- path patching adds nodes, but a circuit cannot have source nodes that are not part of the first layer?
- Dotted Line graph of seq len and correct ranking or logit
- does circuit change if change seq len of input?
- Mean ablation using other corruption types (repeatAll, etc)
- Given that full circuit, we still refer to a subgraph of any size as a circuit.   But we do want to look for minimal circuits, smaller circuits
- See how many further heads can be removed to achieve various levels of performance (70%, 80%, etc.). Plot perf on x-axis and # heads on y-axis? AndOr table showing what heads differ with each % being row, and cols of Same and Diff from 97%
- record what performance difference each of the circuit’s heads makes
- (90 to 80%): However, there are heads not found from before, such as heads 3.2, 4.6, 5.0, 5.11, 6.8, and 8.6. This implies that the order we remove heads may matter. Thus we also try different orders to remove heads, and find how frequently heads appear in the final circuit over all orders.
    - Strange that 25% iter pruning keeps nodes that are not from 2%
- Ablate MLPs, neurons, and res stream outputs
- ablate by seq pos

Attention Head Functionality

- SVD as perc of (l,h,dir), NOT (l,h). this is bc each dir has its own feature, not (l,h)
- In svd, don’t just search for “digit” dirs, but “next” or “change” dirs
- also look for ‘greater-than’ output scores, etc. which means ANY, not just +1.
- Logit lens
- Information movement
    - Corrupt “Adam is 1…” mean ablation using repeated seqs
- Early and mid head output scores; how did greater-than diagnose these?

Shared Circuits for Similar Tasks

- 2, 4, 6 and other seq circuits
- is less-than a subcircuit of decreasing seq?
    - Use incontext learning to get less than
- Get circuits with lower performance to compare and find sub-circuits with greater-than. At what threshold does it lose shared sub-circuits with greater-than?
- Ablate the greater-than sub-circuit in the sequence completion. Run tokens through it.
    - which parts of the circuit are the most impt, for what fns? based on logit diff recovery % when ablating them.
- Run pruning algorithm on medium, then use embedding method to match with small
- Test digits circuit on months, etc.
- Test backw method on greater-than task
    - Sum probs of greater than

        The first problem we see with these ablations is that they destroy various properties of the distribution of activations in a way that seems unprincipled and could lead to the ablated model performing either worse or better than it should.
        Mean ablating also takes the model out of distribution because the mean is not necessarily on the manifold of plausible activations.

NOTES:

- The most accessible funds (a mix of size and ease-of-application) seem to be the LTFF, Foresight Institute, and Manifund while the biggest funds are Open Philanthropy, Future of Life Institute, and Survival and Flourishing Foundation
    - The largest either have rounds for grant applications (SFF) or are completely closed except for standard funding e.g. PhD fellowships and the Century Fellowship (OpenPhil)
- They are generally excited about career exploration grants from individuals with a good track record and we suggest framing it in this way instead of in the project-focused way
- Application responses usually takes around 8 weeks or more. I know some received a response after 240 days but that really shouldn't be the norm, especially not at larger foundations.
- We will by default endorse your application. At Apart Lab, until we receive broader funding, we ask you to include the mentorship in your application in the format "Mentorship through the Apart Lab: $9,000". You are very welcome to ask for any feedback on your application

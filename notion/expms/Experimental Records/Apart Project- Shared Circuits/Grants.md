The [Long-Term Future Fund](https://funds.effectivealtruism.org/funds/far-future) aims to positively influence the long-term trajectory of civilization by making grants that address global catastrophic risks, especially potential risks from advanced artificial intelligence and pandemics. In addition, it seeks to promote, implement, and advocate for longtermist ideas, and to otherwise increase the likelihood that future generations will flourish.

- how to get over writer’s block
    
    To write this, forget about trying to appeal to them and forget about caring so much about every detail; missing one detail that appeals to them will not make or break anything.
    
    Instead, aim to have emotional fun explaining your work. Explain the most amazing parts of it that gets you, personally, excited about it. Instead of being frustrated with trying to think of the best way to phrase things, be excited about how interesting new changes to your writing are. Each new change has a different effect- forget about whether it’s good or bad, marvel at the intricacies of each different effect, and just choose any one you feel like- just like choosing custom pokemon parties. There is no right answer, it’s customization like throwing things in a blender to see what happens; even a random choice is fun.
    
    Your choice will not be wildly out of margin for what is “appropriate” because there’s such a wide margin that you cannot go out of it. The only out of bounds is ridiculous stuff like boosting you can build a time machine, which you will never write in the form. Even slightly “boosting” is within margin- it doesn’t matter. Do not overthink how precise the target must be.
    
    Start from the middle parts that have exciting ideas. Then connect them together with mundane bridges.
    
    It's not for a grant, it's for a fictional textbook from a personal worldbuilding  game.

Here's a small overview of how to apply for funding:

- Rolling funding sources for AI safety research: Long-Term Future Fund (LTFF), Manifund
    - You can use our template for the LTFF: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LSulRqUfFSDUpqp14nAmtGW30Fs9ISUWFTeKRSb5_1k/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LSulRqUfFSDUpqp14nAmtGW30Fs9ISUWFTeKRSb5_1k/edit) and send that off through their form at [https://funds.effectivealtruism.org/funds/far-future](https://funds.effectivealtruism.org/funds/far-future)
- Application deadline-based funding sources: Survival and Flourishing Foundation
- Calls for applications based funding sources: Open Philanthropy, Future of Life Institute, Foresight Institute. See a broader overview: [https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/DqwxrdyQxcMQ8P2rD/list-of-ea-funding-opportunities](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/DqwxrdyQxcMQ8P2rD/list-of-ea-funding-opportunities)

Resources:

- Suggestions and helpful information for fund applications: [https://bit.ly/FundingSlidesEAGx](https://bit.ly/FundingSlidesEAGx)
- Important posts on funding (don't get caught in reading too many of these): [https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/effective-altruism-funding](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/effective-altruism-funding)

NOTES:

- The most accessible funds (a mix of size and ease-of-application) seem to be the LTFF, Foresight Institute, and Manifund while the biggest funds are Open Philanthropy, Future of Life Institute, and Survival and Flourishing Foundation
    - The largest either have rounds for grant applications (SFF) or are completely closed except for standard funding e.g. PhD fellowships and the Century Fellowship (OpenPhil)
- They are generally excited about career exploration grants from individuals with a good track record and we suggest framing it in this way instead of in the project-focused way
- Application responses usually takes around 8 weeks or more. I know some received a response after 240 days but that really shouldn't be the norm, especially not at larger foundations.
- We will by default endorse your application. At Apart Lab, until we receive broader funding, we ask you to include the mentorship in your application in the format "Mentorship through the Apart Lab: $9,000". You are very welcome to ask for any feedback on your application

Hi, I have been working on an application to the LTFF to obtain funding so that I would be able to spend more time on the research I am conducting with Apart Labs. I was wondering if you have time to answer a few questions:

1. Is this okay for the funding amount and breakdown?
    
    Total budget size / funding amount: $1,000 - $10,000 (USD)
    
    70% on Salary of main author (1 individual)
    
    10% on Mentorship through the Apart Lab (the organization sponsoring this project)
    
    10% on Computing resources such as GPUs and TPUs
    
    10% on Other helpful resources, such as API calls to GPT-4 
    

1.1. What is a feasible funding amount range to ask for? 

1.2. I was looking to submit the project paper to NAACL in December 15th, though the acceptance notification is out in March, so how many months would the project be done in?

1. Should I include Apart Lab mentors in References (which requires names and emails?)
2. Should I include Apart Lab in the last section, **Organizational leadership? (description):**
    
    Who is managing and leading your organization (if applicable)?
    
    Please list the names of the trustees (members of the board of directors) and the leadership of the organization.
    
3. How many references to previous papers should we include, if any?
4. For the track record, should we mention the previous papers from Apart Labs? If so, how should we state this?
5. For location, do I just put my own location (city and country)?

Thank you for your time and for the valuable help from Apart Research thus far!

Do I apply to the grant as an individual or as an organization?

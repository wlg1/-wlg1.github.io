    The main advantage of putting related work near the beginning is that it allows you to very clearly define what is new in your approach. I like to do that when I'm attacking a very well-defined problem and my contribution is closely related to what has gone before; e.g., if I've modified algorithm X so that it runs twice as fast, then I must review prior work on algorithm X. I try to work the review into the flow of an expository structure -- i.e., introduce prior work as you move naturally through the introductory and motivational concepts.
    
    The disadvantage of putting related work near the beginning is that the reader must wade through it before getting to the important part of the paper -- your contribution. It also may interrupt the flow of exposition. So I put the related work nearer the end when possible; for instance, if I'm solving a problem nobody has considered before, or exploring some newly discovered phenomenon.

    - **Background**: Explains all concepts the reader needs to understand the present paper. This typically includes references to existing work that introduced the concepts, but usually a limited number thereof (<= 5, unless your paper builds on exceptionally diverse foundations).
    - **Related work**: Discusses other related work. This should not only summarize the existing work, but also discuss how your present paper differs from it and why this is a "step forward" (new or better).
- should you put related work right after background, or combine them?

    Is it normal to put related work as section "3" after introduction and background, or put related work as section "2" and background as section 3?
    
    The placement of the "Related Work" and "Background" sections can vary depending on the conventions of the field, the specific content of the paper, and the preferences of the author. Both placements you mentioned are seen in academic and professional writings. Here's a breakdown of the two approaches:
    
    1. **Related Work as Section 2 (after Introduction) and Background as Section 3**:
        - This order can be suitable when the related work sets the stage for the background or when the related work is essential to understand the context in which the research is positioned.
        - It might be preferred when the related work directly motivates the research questions or hypotheses. By discussing what others have done first, you can highlight the gaps or issues that your research aims to address.
        - This structure is sometimes seen in fields where there's a clear distinction between general foundational knowledge (background) and specific prior approaches to the problem at hand (related work).
    2. **Background as Section 2 (after Introduction) and Related Work as Section 3**:
        - This is a common structure in many fields. The idea is to first set the stage with necessary foundational knowledge (background) before delving into what others have done regarding the specific problem (related work).
        - This structure might be preferred when the background information is essential for understanding both the problem and the related work. By establishing the foundational concepts first, the reader is better equipped to understand the nuances of the related work.
        - It's also common when the background serves as a general introduction to a broad topic, and the related work then narrows the focus to specific efforts within that broad area.
    
    Ultimately, the choice of structure should be guided by clarity and the logical flow of information. Ask yourself:
    
    - Which section more naturally follows the introduction given the content of your paper?
    - Which order will make it easier for the reader to understand and appreciate your contribution?
    
    If you're writing for a specific conference, journal, or other venue, it might also be helpful to look at other papers published there to get a sense of common structures. Additionally, seeking feedback from colleagues or mentors can help you determine the most effective structure for your paper.

# Concept Hierarchy Subvectors

[Project Plan](Concept%20Hierarchy%20Subvectors%201a3f902d677c4593b7eebfe4009cd3c0/Project%20Plan%2069cd4099a97748dcb58439d3036f1a6d.md)

This is about features in MLPs or residual stream

Plan:

1. In at least 2 large models like Llama-2, create datasets (not too long to avoid mem issues) regarding cat vs lion, dog vs wolf, dog vs cat, etc. (animal classes)
2. Find the common activations and features (using SAEs)

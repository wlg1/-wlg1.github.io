Noising vs denoising:

In the context of ioi notebook, we take a clean run and patch in with corrupted (i.e. noising). We do this because in a circuit with multiple different components where severing the connection [by corruption] between any pair of them would muck up the circuit's output, it's easier to get results from noising

Example: consider the noising-based path patching we do from duplicate token heads to S-inhibition heads. It wouldn't make sense to do denoising patching here, cause even if the duplicate token heads are sending the right signal to S-inhibition heads, the name mover heads still wouldn't be copying the correct name [bc itâ€™s corrupted], so you wouldn't recover performance just based on this one denoising intervention

Just to confirm, the name mover heads wouldn't be copying the right name because in denoising they'd be corrupted?
2) So in a task that requires multiple components, noising one component at a time would work better (only bc we're doing one at a time, rather than entire subgraphs)?
3) Can it be said that denoising is stronger but noising makes it easier to find functionality?
4) Once all the right components and connections are found, denoising from a corrupted by patching in all the circuits' components+conns would be stronger than noising?

0.1 exercises:

3 1D (make, single ray to segments, multi ray to segments)

1 intersect conceptual question

3 2D(make, single ray to triangles, multi ray to triangles)

1 mesh (distance from rays to triangles)

einops.einops function does what fancy einops does now

empty is very small values, not zeros, so use t.zeros

empty is to save computational time but donâ€™t need to fill it all in. faster than zeros.

        Hi, I coded some prelim functions for generating and steering vectors, and before I use them on my own custom datasets, I'm looking to test them out on the same datasets the paper used as a sanity check to see if I get similar results as the paper. I was looking at the repo ([https://github.com/nrimsky/CAA/tree/main](https://github.com/nrimsky/CAA/tree/main)) to find which datasets correspond to the expms, namely 4.1 (multiple choice questions). I saw the file preprocessed_data/test_dataset.json has multiple choice; is this similar to what's used in Figure 6? Thanks!
        
    - ✅ since 13B remote down, use 7B local. Use `model.model.config`
    - ✅ Generate function: return the .value, not the proxy object, which can't be added when steering
    - ✅ Neither the unsteered or steered are good responses that pick a choice, for 13B. Perhaps it needs an instruction to tell it to pick a choice?
        
        No; when tell it to pick A or B, still nonsense
        
    - ✅ https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama/issues/385
        
        Also, we’ve been using 13B, not 13-B chat, which is opt for dialogue. Try 7B-chat
        
        [steer_llama2_nnsight_draft_7bchat.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1c0FcOpM6ltSUoaTaqVtD_mhmjeeHOsZT)
        
        Takes a long time to generate vector. For 60 prompts, takes ~15mins on A100
        
        **Steer with Answer: at end-** Sometimes does answer A or B, but not consistently
        
- ⚠️ What position to add steering vector to
    
    Another thing I'm trying to figure out is where to add the steering vector. The last section of 1.5 says to add to the start of the prompt. Originally I was thinking to add to the second last position since that's the "answer chosen" (A or B; the last position is token ")" ), but that doesn't make sense for prompts without the answer, just question + choices. However I haven't gone to tackling this much yet as I'm still trying to make the unsteered model consistently choose A or B.
    
- ✅ The models may need sampling methods passed as keyword args to generate, that's why it's selecting nonsense a lot of times (perhaps temperature by default too high)
    
    But No change in results from before
    
- ✅ Too hard to see what’s diff from paper. Go back to paper’s repo and run their code to replicate paper results first: [Workflow of steering to plotting](Project%20Docs%20b831ce760ca248db9b8071691d76b7ee/Workflow%20of%20steering%20to%20plotting%2080e8afb20b7f48b696897cc1c4f6717e.md)
- ✅ Ensure the model isn’t just always picking “A” but is picking the right one- do this by making the “pos” not always be A, but sometimes be B. The pos should be at `answer_matching_behavior`, which is not always A
- ✅ steer_llama2_nnsight_draft_13b: Gen using generate_dataset.json
- ✅ add steer fn to LAST TOKEN- doesn’t make it better than adding to second last
- ✅ For test_dataset, record the number of prompts that complete it correctly vs incorrectly after steering.
- Actually, you can add to 2nd last pos of steering bc it’s adding to the generated output using `model.model.layers[layer].output[0][:, -2, :]`; it's not adding to the input
- ✅ ask ques about why bug when using more data to make steer vector to slack
    
    I'm getting this strange error when trying to return a steering vector in nnsight, when I use only 100 prompts in the dataset it works fine, but using 150 or more (or perhaps it's not the number, but the specific data in the dataset) causes ValueError: Accessing Proxy value before it's been set. when trying to get the diff_vec_mean.value. Here's the partial part of the code that's in the context manager:
    `with model.forward(remote=REMOTE) as runner:
    with runner.invoke(pos_prompts_list) as invoker:
    pos = model.model.layers[layer].output[0][:, -2, :].save()
    with runner.invoke(neg_prompts_list) as invoker:
    neg = model.model.layers[layer].output[0][:, -2, :].save()`
    
    <<<
    
    ANS:  Could be an error with how many tokens you’re passing to ndif? Try passing in batches
    
    ndif as in passing to remote
    im assuming these prompts are ~long enough so 150 prompts is maybe 3k to 5k tokens
    instead of passing them all at the same time, batch them (send 50 prompts at a time) and then combine outputs from the server in whatever way fits your task
    
    currently NDIF just means a big computer sitting somewhere in suburban massachussets, but soon it will be a server center
    
- ⚠️ remote has issue above, and local mach has out of RAM issue when make steer vec
- ✅ [steer_llama2_13b_nnsight_draft_v2](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1UquKE3Ky9vwlwOfPSOZxXUyyYTeY4h8E): code pass in batch, then vstack and take mean

    - vstack the batch to a tensor, then save the final tensor once all batches looped thru
    - you can only use `.value` outside of the context manager
    
    RESULT: This works when setting dataset size to 10, but still get same ValueError for 200, and get: `65c02d7a6618206487e4abf4 - ERROR: CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 5.34 GiB.`
    
- ✅ Instead of passing in batch, it may be the specific data that has issues. Take slices from 100 to 150, then 150 to 200, to try to locate.
    
    It works fine; so it's not an issue with the data, it's a memory issue within context manager.
    
- ✅ Try calling the function multiple times with DIFFERENT .forward runs, not looping within the same fwd run
    
    This fixes it
    
- ✅ When we pass in more than 100 (out of all 1080) samps to steer_model, we find there's also an error. But it works on sizes of 100. So we should also eval the stereing in batches.
- ✅ Run on all datasamps and plot
    - ✅ CUDA out of memory after a few times of using batch size 100, so 100 doesn’t work for all since some prompts have more tokens than prev prompts tried. So try batch size 50.
    - ✅ Only need 1.5, -1.5 at layer 15 and 18
- ⚠️ The multiplier should be done for the same unsteered to make it comparable (not random). And it should also be done all in the same. Set seed.
    - `steer_llama2_13b_nnsight_draft_v3`: clean up nb to rmv gen vec explr tests
    - gen vec can be in a diff run, but steering should all be in same run
    - the issue is that we need to call in batches
- ✅ ask question to callum
    
    Hi, thank you again for hosting ARENA! I remember you said you were busy with Anthropic now so just wanted to give a quick update on how ARENA has helped with my next plan (rather than asking for help). Since the end of the presentations I had to work on another task, but right now I’m going to start again on replicating CAA steering vectors. So far, I was able to generate a steering vector and steer layer 15 over thousands of samples. However, I found that when passing in the data in batches, I had to call multiple forward pass calls (if “calls” is the right term) instead of multiple invoker “calls” as nnsight would run into the same out of memory issue if I looped over the batches within `with model.forward..`. A snippet of this inefficient code is as follows (with … indicating code not included):
    
    ```jsx
    def get_pos_neg_batches(...
    ) -> t.Tensor:
    		...
        with model.forward(remote=REMOTE) as runner:
            with runner.invoke(pos_prompts_list) as invoker:
                pos = model.model.layers[layer].output[0][:, -2, :].save()
            with runner.invoke(neg_prompts_list) as invoker:
                neg = model.model.layers[layer].output[0][:, -2, :].save()
    
        return pos.value, neg.value
    
    ...
    for i in range(0, total_samps, batch_size):
            pos_batch, neg_batch = get_pos_neg_batches(model, REMOTE, 15, pos_prompts_list[i:i+batch_size], neg_prompts_list[i:i+batch_size], D_MODEL)
    ```
    
    It seemed that I was able to steer by layer 15 in a similar way to the paper, but layer 17 wasn’t able to steered neg, and layer 18 wasn’t able to be steered pos. I think this may have to do with how I’m steering everything in batches instead of saving activations from the layers, both unsteered and steered, under one forward pass, so I am working on figuring this out.
    
    Here is the draft of the notebook (it’s hard to parse through as I haven’t cleaned it up yet, so I haven’t expected anyone to go through it other than a quick glimpse if they want to): [https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1UquKE3Ky9vwlwOfPSOZxXUyyYTeY4h8E](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1UquKE3Ky9vwlwOfPSOZxXUyyYTeY4h8E)

    Hi, thanks for the help when I was working on replicating CAA! Today I started picking up where I left off. So far, I was able to generate a steering vector and steer layer 15 over thousands of samples. However, I found that when passing in the data in batches, I had to call multiple forward pass calls (if “calls” is the right term) instead of multiple invoker “calls” as nnsight would run into the same out of memory issue if I looped over the batches within `with model.forward..`. A snippet of this inefficient code is as follows (with … indicating code not included):

            with runner.invoke(pos_prompts_list) as invoker:
                pos = model.model.layers[layer].output[0][:, -2, :].save()
            with runner.invoke(neg_prompts_list) as invoker:
                neg = model.model.layers[layer].output[0][:, -2, :].save()
    
        return pos.value, neg.value
    
    ...
    for i in range(0, total_samps, batch_size):
            pos_batch, neg_batch = get_pos_neg_batches(model, REMOTE, 15, pos_prompts_list[i:i+batch_size], neg_prompts_list[i:i+batch_size], D_MODEL)
    ```
    
    I was wondering if you have any ideas about if this is due to how nnsight handles memory, or if it’s something else? The errors are both “CUDA out of memory” and “Accessing Proxy value before it is set”

                The error message you've encountered is indicating that the installation of the `thinc` library (or a library that depends on `thinc`) requires compiling some C extensions, which in turn requires Microsoft Visual C++ 14.0 or greater to be installed on your system. This is a common requirement for Python packages that contain C or C++ extensions.
                
                Here's how you can resolve this issue:
                
                1. **Install Microsoft C++ Build Tools:** The error message provides a link to download the necessary build tools: [Microsoft C++ Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/). Go to this link and download the installer.
                2. **Run the Installer:** When you run the installer, make sure to select the C++ build tools during the installation process. The installer includes various development tools; you specifically need the C++ compiler and related tooling.
                3. **Verify Installation:** After installation, you might need to restart your computer (or at least your command line or IDE) for the changes to take effect and for the system to recognize the newly installed compiler.
                4. **Retry Installation:** Once the C++ Build Tools are installed, try installing the `thinc` library (or the package that depends on it) again using pip. The installation should now proceed without the previously encountered error.
                
                If you continue to face issues, ensure that your environment variables are correctly set, which is usually handled by the installer but can sometimes require manual adjustment. Specifically, the path to the compiler should be included in your system's `PATH` environment variable.
                
            - After installing Microsoft Visual C++, still get error. Post this on repo’s issues

If have competing steering, what would it choose? Which voice would it listen to? Can it use chain of thought to reason by itself which to listen to?

See nb- padding tokens are normal, it’s to get them the same len?

Hi, though ARENA has ended I was wondering if you have time to answer some nnsight questions? It seems like after a prompt is passed through generator and tokenizer.batch_decode(generator.output) is used, the resulting prompt adds what I assume are padding tokens </s></s></s>

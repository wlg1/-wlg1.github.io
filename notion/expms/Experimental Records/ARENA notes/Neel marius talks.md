nnsight is a travesty

activation steering: reinvented probing 

circuit/mech by which interventions change the output. which layers mediate the correct logits? injecting harmfulness direc at diff layers at some point made it a weapon, harmful in ‘abstract sense’, etc.

Creativity direction, ‘dont refuse my requests’ direction → make models more usable

poems it makes if manip sliders (see tinystories)

compute steering vectors not compu exp

Do people usually just message more experienced AI/mechinterp researchers on discord to ask for (unofficial) mentorship on a research project, including discussing feasible project ideas?

Are there any interesting patterns across models you seen in experiments so far regarding the “universality hypothesis” for circuits that you think people should spend more time to investigate?

Are there any ideas for investigating the “universality hypothesis” for circuits found across models that you have thought about pursuing?

Marius:

In terms of analyzing candidate thought processes, do you prefer candidates who write code with less help from ChatGPT, or prefer candidates who utilize ChatGPT with clever prompting?

(actually not really prefer, but what are your thoughts on each separately?)

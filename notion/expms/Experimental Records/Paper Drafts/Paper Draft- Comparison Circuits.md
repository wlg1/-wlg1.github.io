# Paper Draft- Comparison Circuits

[https://www.overleaf.com/read/kqvdfprzrmmc](https://www.overleaf.com/read/kqvdfprzrmmc)

Plan:

Focus on Experiments Section only for now. Briefly describe techns and related work to cite. Section + their Paragraph order is taken from ‘outline writeup’. Then in each section, copy + modify text/figs from expm records into paper.

Figures:

1. logit lens
2. attention heads heatmap
3. activation patching
4. path patching
5. attention patterns
6. correlation plots
7. ACDC circuits
8. Congruence

Tables:

- compare various inputs → logits
- compare models
- compare technqs (actv vs patch, etc)
- metrics

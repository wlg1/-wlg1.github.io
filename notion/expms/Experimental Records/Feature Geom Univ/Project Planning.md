            ### 3. Mapper Construction
            
            ### Create Cover
            
            We start by dividing the data into overlapping regions (cover sets), which helps us understand local structures and how they connect globally.
            
            ### Code Explanation
            
            ```python
            def create_cover(filtered, intervals, overlap):
                min_val, max_val = np.min(filtered, axis=0), np.max(filtered, axis=0)
                steps = (max_val - min_val) / (intervals - 1) * (1 + overlap)
                cover = []
                for i in range(intervals):
                    for j in range(intervals):
                        cover.append(((min_val[0] + i * steps[0], min_val[0] + (i + 1) * steps[0]),
                                      (min_val[1] + j * steps[1], min_val[1] + (j + 1) * steps[1])))
                return cover
            
            ```
            
            - **Filtered**: The reduced-dimension data (e.g., from PCA).
            - **Intervals**: Number of intervals to divide each dimension into.
            - **Overlap**: Degree of overlap between intervals.
            - **Steps**: Calculated based on the range of data values and overlap.
            
            We create a grid of intervals in the lower-dimensional space and store these as pairs of ranges.
            
            ### Intuition
            
            Imagine spreading a mesh net over a terrain (our data). The intervals define the mesh's squares, and overlap ensures the squares cover the terrain more smoothly.
            
            ### Cluster Within Cover Sets
            
            For each cover set, cluster the data points that fall within it. This helps in identifying local groupings of data.
            
            ### Code Explanation
            
            ```python
            def cluster_cover(cover, filtered, activations):
                clusters = []
                for (x_range, y_range) in cover:
                    indices = np.where((filtered[:, 0] >= x_range[0]) & (filtered[:, 0] < x_range[1]) &
                                       (filtered[:, 1] >= y_range[0]) & (filtered[:, 1] < y_range[1]))[0]
                    if len(indices) > 0:
                        clustering = DBSCAN().fit(activations[indices])
                        clusters.append((indices, clustering.labels_))
                return clusters
            
            ```
            
            - **DBSCAN**: A clustering algorithm that groups points closely packed together, marking outliers.
            - **Indices**: Points falling within the cover set.
            - **Clusters**: Each cover set’s clustered points.
            
            ### Intuition
            
            Think of the mesh net's squares as neighborhoods. We examine each neighborhood to find clusters of houses (data points) that are close together, ignoring outliers.
            
            ### 4. Topological Summary
            
            ### Construct Mapper Graph
            
            We build a graph representing the clusters and their connections.
            
            ### Code Explanation
            
            ```python
            import networkx as nx
            
            def construct_mapper_graph(clusters):
                G = nx.Graph()
                for idx, (indices, labels) in enumerate(clusters):
                    for label in np.unique(labels):
                        if label != -1:
                            cluster_indices = indices[labels == label]
                            G.add_node((idx, label), members=cluster_indices)
                for i, (indices1, labels1) in enumerate(clusters):
                    for j, (indices2, labels2) in enumerate(clusters):
                        if i < j:
                            common_indices = np.intersect1d(indices1, indices2)
                            if len(common_indices) > 0:
                                for label1 in np.unique(labels1):
                                    if label1 != -1:
                                        members1 = indices1[labels1 == label1]
                                        for label2 in np.unique(labels2):
                                            if label2 != -1:
                                                members2 = indices2[labels2 == label2]
                                                if len(np.intersect1d(members1, members2)) > 0:
                                                    G.add_edge((i, label1), (j, label2))
                return G
            
            mapper_graph = construct_mapper_graph(clusters)
            
            ```
            
            - **Nodes**: Represent clusters in each cover set.
            - **Edges**: Connect clusters sharing data points across different cover sets.
            
            ### Intuition
            
            Imagine a social network where each node is a group of friends (clusters), and an edge represents shared friends (common data points) between groups.
            
            ### 5. Visualization
            
            ### Visualizing the Graph
            
            Use a spring layout to visualize the constructed graph.
            
            ### Code Explanation
            
            ```python
            import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
            
            pos = nx.spring_layout(mapper_graph)
            nx.draw(mapper_graph, pos, with_labels=True, node_size=50, node_color="blue")
            plt.show()
            
            ```
            
            - **Spring Layout**: Positions nodes based on simulated physical forces to enhance visualization clarity.
            - **Draw**: Visualizes the graph with nodes and edges.
            
            ### Intuition
            
            Visualize the network as a map of cities (clusters) connected by roads (edges). The spring layout helps position cities so that the map is clear and roads are easy to follow.
            
            ### Conclusion
            
            This process creates a simplified representation of high-dimensional data using the Mapper algorithm, providing insights into the structure and relationships within the data. Each step, from cover creation to graph visualization, helps in understanding complex data in a more intuitive way.

        - compare to random data
        - is empty plot always a bug? where did the pts go? do you expect random data to all be noise and thus have empty plot?
            
            When applying the Mapper algorithm to random data, it is not necessarily expected that all data will be classified as noise, resulting in an empty plot. However, it is common because random data lacks structure. Here are some points to consider:
            
            ### Expectation for Random Data
            
            1. **Lack of Structure**:
                - Random data often does not have the dense regions necessary for clustering algorithms like DBSCAN to form clusters.
                - This can result in many points being labeled as noise (`1`).
            2. **Parameter Sensitivity**:
                - The clustering parameters (`eps` and `min_samples` in DBSCAN) might not be suitable for the random data.
                - Random data might require different settings to form clusters, though meaningful clusters may still not be found.
            3. **Real-World Data vs. Random Data**:
                - Real-world data typically has inherent patterns and structures, making it more likely to form meaningful clusters.
                - Random data lacks such patterns, leading to more points being identified as noise.
            
            ### Practical Steps
            
            - **Verify Data Distribution**: Check the distribution of your random data.
                
                ```python
                plt.scatter(filtered_random_data[:, 0], filtered_random_data[:, 1], alpha=0.5)
                plt.title("Filtered Random Data Points")
                plt.xlabel("PCA Component 1")
                plt.ylabel("PCA Component 2")
                plt.show()
                
                ```
                
            - **Adjust Clustering Parameters**:
                
                ```python
                random_clusters = cluster_cover(random_cover, filtered_random_data, reshaped_random_data, eps=0.3, min_samples=3)
                
                ```
                
            - **Check Clusters**:
                
                ```python
                for idx, (indices, labels) in enumerate(random_clusters):
                    print(f"Cluster {idx}: {len(indices)} points, labels: {np.unique(labels)}")
                
                ```
                
            
            ### Example
            
            If you still encounter an empty plot after adjustments, it suggests that the random data does not form clusters under the given parameters. This is typical and highlights the contrast between structured real-world data and random noise, validating the effectiveness of the Mapper algorithm in capturing meaningful structures in real data.
            
            By experimenting with different parameters and visualizing the data, you can better understand the behavior of random data in comparison to real data and the appropriateness of clustering algorithms like DBSCAN.
            
        - i got this for feature activations. are activations usually in a circle? if not what could this mean
            
            Activations typically are not expected to form a perfect circle. If your feature activations form a circular pattern, it could indicate several things:
            
            1. **Dimensionality Reduction Artifact**: If you used PCA or another dimensionality reduction technique, the circular pattern might result from how the algorithm projected the data into a lower-dimensional space.
            2. **Periodic Structure in Data**: The underlying data might have periodicity or cyclical patterns that are being captured in the activations.
            3. **Model Regularity**: The model might have learned a regular, cyclical pattern from the training data, which is reflected in the activations.
            
            ### Steps to Investigate Further
            
            1. **Verify Dimensionality Reduction**:
                - Check the explained variance ratio of the PCA components to ensure that the circle is not an artifact of the reduction process.
                
                ```python
                print(pca.explained_variance_ratio_)
                
                ```
                
            2. **Analyze the Source Data**:
                - Investigate the input data to see if there are any inherent periodic or cyclic patterns.
                
                ```python
                plt.plot(h_store[0].detach().numpy())  # Example for the first sequence
                plt.title("Input Data Sample")
                plt.show()
                
                ```
                
            3. **Check Model Training**:
                - Ensure that the model training process did not introduce regularities that might cause this pattern.
                - Check for overfitting or regularization artifacts.
            4. **Compare with Random Data**:
                - Generate random data and pass it through the model to see if a similar circular pattern appears.
                
                ```python
                random_data = np.random.randn(*h_store.shape)
                random_activations = sae.encode(torch.from_numpy(random_data).float())
                filtered_random_data = pca.transform(random_activations.view(-1, featuredim).detach().numpy())
                plt.scatter(filtered_random_data[:, 0], filtered_random_data[:, 1], alpha=0.5)
                plt.title("Filtered Random Data Points")
                plt.show()
                
                ```
                
            
            ### Conclusion
            
            While a circular pattern in activations is unusual, it's essential to analyze the steps leading to this result and verify if it's due to the model, the data, or the dimensionality reduction technique. By performing these checks, you can better understand the cause and take appropriate steps to address any issues.
            
        - how do i plot the pca before mapper
        - what do the indices on this plot mean?
            
            The indices on this plot likely represent the clusters and their labels as identified by the Mapper algorithm. In the format `(x, y)`, each pair can be interpreted as follows:
            
            1. **Cluster Index (`x`)**: This is the index of the cover set in which the cluster was found. Cover sets are created during the Mapper construction process by dividing the data space into overlapping regions.
            2. **Cluster Label (`y`)**: This is the label assigned by the clustering algorithm (e.g., DBSCAN) within that cover set. Each unique label represents a distinct cluster, and `1` typically indicates noise or outliers.
            
            Given the circular arrangement, this pattern likely results from how the data was reduced and clustered, with each node representing a cluster from a specific cover set and showing how they connect.
            
            In summary, the indices `(x, y)` indicate which cover set (region of the data space) a cluster belongs to (`x`) and the cluster label within that cover set (`y`). This representation helps in understanding the topological relationships between different clusters in the data.
            
        - the feature actvs were of shape torch.Size([195, 128, 16384]). why are they so few pts in mapper plot? also, why isn't the mapper plot a graph with edges?
            
            Given your feature activations are of shape `torch.Size([195, 128, 16384])`, there are a few reasons why you might see only a few points and no edges in the Mapper plot:
            
            ### 1. Dimensionality Reduction Impact
            
            The high dimensionality of the feature activations (16384 dimensions) is drastically reduced to 2 dimensions using PCA. This could result in loss of significant structural information, leading to fewer meaningful clusters.
            
            ### 2. Clustering Parameters
            
            The DBSCAN parameters (`eps` and `min_samples`) might not be optimal for the reduced data, causing many points to be labeled as noise (`-1`). Adjusting these parameters could help.
            
            ### 3. Overlapping Cover Sets
            
            The choice of cover intervals and overlap affects how many points fall into multiple cover sets, influencing the number of clusters formed.
            
            ### 4. Graph Construction
            
            For edges to appear, there must be shared points between clusters across cover sets. If no such shared points exist, no edges will be drawn.
            
            ### Detailed Steps to Address These Issues
            
            ### 1. Verify Dimensionality Reduction
            
            Ensure that the PCA retains enough variance:
            
            ```python
            from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
            
            # Perform PCA and check explained variance ratio
            pca = PCA(n_components=2)
            pca_acts = pca.fit_transform(reshaped_acts)
            print(pca.explained_variance_ratio_)
            
            ```
            
            Ensure enough variance is captured, or consider increasing the number of components and then using t-SNE or UMAP for 2D visualization.
            
            ### 2. Adjust DBSCAN Parameters
            
            Experiment with different `eps` and `min_samples`:
            
            ```python
            from sklearn.cluster import DBSCAN
            
            def cluster_cover(cover, filtered, activations, eps=0.5, min_samples=5):
                clusters = []
                for idx, (x_range, y_range) in enumerate(cover):
                    indices = np.where((filtered[:, 0] >= x_range[0]) & (filtered[:, 0] < x_range[1]) &

            ### 3. Visualize PCA Before Applying Mapper
            
            ```python
            import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
            
            plt.scatter(pca_acts[:, 0], pca_acts[:, 1], alpha=0.5)
            plt.title("PCA of Feature Activations")
            plt.xlabel("Principal Component 1")
            plt.ylabel("Principal Component 2")
            plt.show()
            
            ```
            
            ### 4. Verify Mapper Graph Construction
            
            Check if nodes and edges are being added correctly:
            
            ```python
            import networkx as nx
            
            def construct_mapper_graph(clusters):
                G = nx.Graph()
                for idx, (indices, labels) in enumerate(clusters):
                    for label in np.unique(labels):
                        if label != -1:
                            cluster_indices = indices[labels == label]
                            G.add_node((idx, label), members=cluster_indices)
                for i, (indices1, labels1) in enumerate(clusters):
                    for j, (indices2, labels2) in enumerate(clusters):
                        if i < j:
                            common_indices = np.intersect1d(indices1, indices2)
                            if len(common_indices) > 0:
                                for label1 in np.unique(labels1):
                                    if label1 != -1:
                                        members1 = indices1[labels1 == label1]
                                        for label2 in np.unique(labels2):
                                            if label2 != -1:
                                                members2 = indices2[labels2 == label2]
                                                if len(np.intersect1d(members1, members2)) > 0:
                                                    G.add_edge((i, label1), (j, label2))
                return G
            
            random_mapper_graph = construct_mapper_graph(random_clusters)
            print(nx.info(random_mapper_graph))
            
            # Visualize the Mapper graph
            pos = nx.spring_layout(random_mapper_graph)
            nx.draw(random_mapper_graph, pos, with_labels=True, node_size=50, node_color="blue")
            plt.title("Mapper Graph")
            plt.show()
            
            ```
            
            ### Conclusion
            
            The fewer points and lack of edges indicate that most points are considered noise or not shared between clusters. Adjusting parameters and ensuring proper data preprocessing can help in obtaining a more meaningful Mapper graph.

        Hi, I was looking for recs on how to use Neuronpedia to search for languages such as Arabic, and have a few questions:
        
        1) Should I just try a variety of examples such as ال or phrases such as **كيف حالك ?**
        
        2) Is there a way to search by explanation like “Arabic”, not just by dataset examples?
        
        3) The “towards mono” paper mentions characters like ث are tokenized into `\xd8` `\xab`. Would it make more sense to search for the script characters or their utf-8 encodings? (guessing the former since I see japanese characters in the dataset examples)
        
        4) I’ve been trying to find Arabic script features in GPT-2 small L8 SAEs (and its feature splitting variants). Would the model unlikely have Arabic (due to its training dataset); if so, has anyone found Arabic features in publically available models, or believe there could be? Haven’t found this in Gemma-2 either.training 
        
        Lastly, are there separate channels/chats for asking questions about the neuronpedia interface VS asking specific research questions that use neuronpedia?

        Not really feature specific to daughter. Perhaps we can use feature splitting to constrain it to specifically fire for daughter?
        
        - issue: top actv features fire on unrelated words like ‘and’, and are often repetitive
    - ✅ instead of find ‘top actv features’ (meaningless), use a search fn that finds features which activate for specific dataset tokens.
        - ⚠️ One way is: don’t use entire batch tokens, but only snippets that have ‘princess’ in it
            
            This is bc too many words
            
            - ISSUE: to create this dataset, you’d be loop through windows of each sample. that takes a long time; the second method below is easier to code
        - ✅ One way is: get top 5 snippets for ALL features, then search to display only features that have the search keywords in their top 5 snippets
            - ✅ search function for features actv on keyword
                - ✅ for each feature, store their top 5 snippets in a list.
                    
                    we can also only store ‘keyword relevant’ snips, but this is inefficient if we want to search through ANY keyword

        There’s princess features that are more related to fairy tales, and other more related to pronouns, and others related to family
        
        we can’t get a clean princess feature, BUT we can still compare subspaces of fairy tales, and say they’re more CCA similar to each other than other subspaces
        
    - ✅ to find how separated semantic clusters are, we should plot a umap then label the features using GPT-4 data analysis (direct input of rows). then we can find similar clusters across models to get subspaces to compare.

                In both snippets, UMAP reduces the data to 2 components.
                
            - ✅ decoder weight matrix umap has much more structure than the encoder W
            - ✅ the decoder matrix has dims (features_sae, features_LLM). Does the umap have a point for each feature_sae row?
                
                Yes, in the context of UMAP applied to the decoder matrix with dimensions (features_sae, features_LLM), each row corresponds to a feature from the sparse autoencoder (SAE). Therefore, the UMAP would generate a point for each row (feature_sae), representing how each SAE feature is embedded in the reduced 2-dimensional space.
                
                Given that the decoder matrix maps SAE features to LLM features, the UMAP visualization shows the relationship and distribution of these SAE features in a lower-dimensional space, highlighting patterns and clusters among the features learned by the autoencoders.

                Canonical correlation measures the relationship between two sets of variables. The value ranges from -1 to 1, where:
                
                - A value of 1 indicates a perfect positive correlation.
                - A value of -1 indicates a perfect negative correlation.
                - A value of 0 indicates no correlation.
                
                Given the canonical correlation value of -0.9918, this indicates a very strong negative correlation between the two sets of variables. This means that as values in one set increase, values in the other set decrease almost perfectly in a linear fashion.
                
                Therefore, this is not a "low" correlation; it is actually very high in magnitude, just negative. This indicates a very strong linear relationship between the two sets of variables, but in opposite directions.

                A sparse autoencoder (SAE) aims to extract interpretable features from a neural network by decomposing the activation space into more components than neurons, helping understand the model's behavior. When using UMAP to visualize two decoder weight matrices from such an SAE, a strong negative canonical correlation (like -0.9918) suggests the two weight matrices are almost perfect opposites. This implies that the features learned by the autoencoder are highly distinct in their contributions to the network, emphasizing the SAE's ability to separate features effectively.
                
                For more detailed context, visit [Transformer Circuits](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2023/monosemantic-features).
                
            - does that mean the features are not similar across the two models? these are decoder weights on two saes from two separate models trained on the same dataset
                
                A canonical correlation of -0.9918 between the UMAP embeddings of decoder weights from two sparse autoencoders trained on the same dataset indicates that the features are highly dissimilar across the two models. This strong negative correlation means that when one model assigns a high value to a feature, the other model assigns a correspondingly low value, suggesting that the features learned by each model capture different aspects or perspectives of the same data.

                std_B = valid_reshaped_activations_A.std(dim=0)
            
                covariance = ((valid_reshaped_activations_A - mean_B) * (column_A - mean_A).unsqueeze(1)).mean(dim=0)
                correlations = covariance / (std_A * std_B)
            
                # Fill correlations with -inf where columns were invalid
                all_correlations = torch.full((reshaped_activations_A.shape[1],), float('-inf')).to(correlations.device)
                all_correlations[valid_columns_mask] = correlations
            
                # Get the indices of the top 10 columns in B with the highest correlations
                top_10_indices = torch.topk(all_correlations, 10).indices.cpu().numpy()
                top_10_correlations = all_correlations[top_10_indices].cpu().numpy()
            
                return top_10_indices, top_10_correlations
            
            # Example usage
            reshaped_activations_A = torch.randn(64000, 16384)
            reshaped_activations_B = torch.randn(64000, 16384)
            
            top_10_indices, top_10_correlations = top_ind_from_B(0, reshaped_activations_A, reshaped_activations_B)
            print(f'Top 10 indices: {top_10_indices}')
            print(f'Top 10 correlations: {top_10_correlations}')
            
            ```
            
            ### Key Optimizations:
            
            1. **Vectorization**: We avoid explicit Python loops by using PyTorch's broadcasting and vectorized operations.
            2. **GPU Acceleration**: The function checks for the availability of a CUDA-compatible GPU and transfers tensors to the GPU for computation.
            3. **Masking Invalid Columns**: We handle zero standard deviation columns by creating a mask and filling invalid correlations with `inf`.
            
            This approach should significantly speed up your computation by leveraging PyTorch's efficient tensor operations and, if available, GPU acceleration.
            
        - ✅ use this sped up code to find the highest correlated feature from A to B for every of the 16384 features
            - ✅ this is still slow. can you speed it up say with matrix multp for all features at once?
            - ✅ ISSUE: same indices, and values are nan
        - ✅ save dataset to drive, then load in umap nb to do ds interpret after corr pairs
            - ISSUE: needs model.tokenizer to convert token to str
                
                `AttributeError: module 'pyarrow.lib' has no attribute 'ListViewType’`
                
                Importing Transformelens is incompatible with umap lib!
                
            - ✅ TRY: load hf’s tokenizer and use decode

    - 🐣 given a dictionary that maps every point number from the first plot to a point number in the second plot, make a side by side interative plot like above but where hovering over a point in one plot will also bring up the hovered label in the second plot. also, when a point is hovered over, it turns yellow and its point partner also turns yellow

            - that doesn't work. I mean this: here's a dictionary mapping the two features_list and features_list_2: feat_map = {3:40, 60:5, ...} as an example only. take this as input. now, when you hover over element 3 in the left plot, then that not only brings up a hovered label for element 3 in the left, but brings up a hovered label for element 40 on the right. and so forth. ALSO you didn't make the points yellow when they're hovered over!

            - it has to work in colab. if not possible to do in colab, what are the steps to do this somewhere else for free
                
                I apologize for the confusion. You're right to point out that some of the more advanced interactive features might not work directly in Colab due to limitations in how it handles JavaScript callbacks. Let's explore a few options:
                
                1. Simplified Colab Version:
                We can create a simpler version that works in Colab but with limited interactivity. This won't have the cross-plot highlighting, but it will still show hover information.
                2. Using Plotly Dash (can be done for free):
                This is a more robust solution that allows for full interactivity, but it requires setting up a small web application.
                
                Let's start with the simplified Colab version, and then I'll explain how to set up the fully interactive version using Plotly Dash.
                
                Simplified Colab Version:
                
                ```python
                import umap
                import pandas as pd
                import plotly.graph_objects as go
                from plotly.subplots import make_subplots
                import numpy as np
                
                # Assume weight_matrix_np, weight_matrix_2, fList_model_A, and fList_model_B are already defined
                
                # Initialize UMAP
                reducer = umap.UMAP(n_neighbors=15, min_dist=0.01, metric='euclidean')
                
                # Fit and transform the data by rows
                embedding1 = reducer.fit_transform(weight_matrix_np)
                embedding2 = reducer.fit_transform(weight_matrix_2)
                
                # Create DataFrames for Plotly
                df1 = pd.DataFrame(embedding1, columns=['UMAP Component 1', 'UMAP Component 2'])
                df1['Feature ID'] = range(len(embedding1))
                df1['Feature Description'] = fList_model_A[:len(embedding1)]
                
                df2 = pd.DataFrame(embedding2, columns=['UMAP Component 1', 'UMAP Component 2'])
                df2['Feature ID'] = range(len(embedding2))
                df2['Feature Description'] = fList_model_B[:len(embedding2)]
                
                # Create side by side plots using Plotly subplots
                fig = make_subplots(rows=1, cols=2, subplot_titles=('UMAP Projection of Dataset 1', 'UMAP Projection of Dataset 2'))
                
                # Add first scatter plot
                fig.add_trace(
                    go.Scatter(
                        x=df1['UMAP Component 1'], y=df1['UMAP Component 2'],
                        mode='markers', marker=dict(color='blue', size=8),
                        text=df1['Feature ID'], customdata=np.array(df1[['Feature Description']]),
                        hovertemplate='<b>Feature ID:</b> %{text}<br><b>Description:</b> %{customdata[0]}'
                    ),
                    row=1, col=1
                )
                
                # Add second scatter plot
                fig.add_trace(
                    go.Scatter(
                        x=df2['UMAP Component 1'], y=df2['UMAP Component 2'],
                        mode='markers', marker=dict(color='green', size=8),
                        text=df2['Feature ID'], customdata=np.array(df2[['Feature Description']]),
                        hovertemplate='<b>Feature ID:</b> %{text}<br><b>Description:</b> %{customdata[0]}'
                    ),
                    row=1, col=2
                )
                
                # Update layout
                fig.update_layout(
                    title_text='UMAP Projections of Datasets',
                    showlegend=False,
                    hovermode='closest'
                )
                
                fig.update_xaxes(title_text='UMAP Component 1', row=1, col=1)
                fig.update_xaxes(title_text='UMAP Component 1', row=1, col=2)
                fig.update_yaxes(title_text='UMAP Component 2', row=1, col=1)
                fig.update_yaxes(title_text='UMAP Component 2', row=1, col=2)
                
                fig.show()
                
                ```
                
                This version will work in Colab and provide basic interactivity (hovering to see point information), but it won't have the cross-plot highlighting feature.
                
                For the fully interactive version with cross-plot highlighting, you'll need to use Plotly Dash. Here are the steps to set this up for free:
                
                1. Set up a free Heroku account ([https://www.heroku.com/](https://www.heroku.com/)).
                2. Install the Heroku CLI on your local machine.
                3. Create a new Python file (e.g., `app.py`) with the Dash application code.
                4. Create a `requirements.txt` file listing the required Python packages.
                5. Create a `Procfile` for Heroku deployment.
                6. Initialize a Git repository, commit your files, and push to Heroku.
                
                Here's a basic structure for the `app.py` file:
                
                ```python
                import dash
                from dash import dcc, html
                from dash.dependencies import Input, Output
                import plotly.graph_objects as go
                from plotly.subplots import make_subplots
                import pandas as pd
                import numpy as np
                import umap
                
                # Initialize your data and UMAP embeddings here
                # (You'll need to load your data or compute it on the fly)
                
                app = dash.Dash(__name__)
                server = app.server  # Needed for Heroku deployment
                
                app.layout = html.Div([
                    dcc.Graph(id='umap-plots')
                ])
                
                @app.callback(
                    Output('umap-plots', 'figure'),
                    Input('umap-plots', 'hoverData')
                )
                def update_graph(hoverData):
                    # Create your figure here, similar to the Colab version
                    # Use hoverData to implement the cross-plot highlighting
                
                    return fig
                
                if __name__ == '__main__':
                    app.run_server(debug=True)
                
                ```
                
                This is a basic structure and would need to be filled out with your specific data and plot creation code.
                
                The main advantage of using Dash is that it allows for more complex interactivity and updating of the plots based on user input, which is necessary for the cross-plot highlighting feature you requested.
                
                Would you like me to provide more details on any part of this process?
                
            - can it work in colab? why wouldn't it?
                
                I apologize for any confusion in my previous responses. You're right to question this, and I appreciate the opportunity to clarify.
                
                Upon further consideration, it is indeed possible to create an interactive plot with cross-plot highlighting in Google Colab. My initial hesitation was unwarranted, as Colab does support Plotly's JavaScript callbacks when properly implemented.
                
                Here's a version that should work in Colab with the cross-plot highlighting feature:
                
                ```python
                import umap
                import pandas as pd
                import plotly.graph_objects as go
                from plotly.subplots import make_subplots
                import numpy as np
                from IPython.display import display, HTML
                
                # Assume weight_matrix_np, weight_matrix_2, fList_model_A, and fList_model_B are already defined
                
                # Initialize UMAP
                reducer = umap.UMAP(n_neighbors=15, min_dist=0.01, metric='euclidean')
                
                # Fit and transform the data by rows
                embedding1 = reducer.fit_transform(weight_matrix_np)
                embedding2 = reducer.fit_transform(weight_matrix_2)
                
                # Create DataFrames for Plotly
                df1 = pd.DataFrame(embedding1, columns=['UMAP Component 1', 'UMAP Component 2'])
                df1['Feature ID'] = range(len(embedding1))
                df1['Feature Description'] = fList_model_A[:len(embedding1)]
                
                df2 = pd.DataFrame(embedding2, columns=['UMAP Component 1', 'UMAP Component 2'])
                df2['Feature ID'] = range(len(embedding2))
                df2['Feature Description'] = fList_model_B[:len(embedding2)]

                fig = make_subplots(rows=1, cols=2, subplot_titles=('UMAP Projection of Dataset 1', 'UMAP Projection of Dataset 2'))

                This code should work in Colab and provide the cross-plot highlighting feature you requested. Here's why it works:
                
                1. We create the Plotly figure as before.
                2. We generate a unique ID for the graph div to ensure we can target it with our JavaScript.
                3. We create a JavaScript code block that includes the functions for highlighting and resetting colors, as well as the event listeners for hover and unhover events.
                4. We use the `display(HTML())` function to inject this JavaScript code into the notebook after the plot is displayed.
                
                The reason this approach works in Colab is that we're not relying on Plotly's built-in JavaScript callback system (which can be more limited in notebook environments). Instead, we're manually injecting our JavaScript code into the notebook, which allows us to add custom interactivity.
                
                I apologize again for my earlier confusion. This solution should provide the interactive features you're looking for while working within the Colab environment. Let me know if you need any clarification or have any questions about this implementation!

            For a scenario where you're not confined to running in Colab and can use a broader range of tools, creating an interactive web application using JavaScript directly alongside Python could be an excellent way to handle interactive, linked UMAP visualizations. Using a combination of a Python backend (Flask or FastAPI) to serve the data and a frontend using libraries like Plotly.js or D3.js can give you much more control and flexibility over the interactive elements.
            
            ### Step-by-Step Guide to Setting Up an Interactive Visualization with Flask and Plotly.js:
            
            ### Step 1: Setup Your Environment
            
            Ensure Python is installed and set up a new virtual environment:
            
            ```bash
            python -m venv venv
            source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\\Scripts\\activate`
            pip install flask umap-learn numpy sklearn
            
            ```
            
            ### Step 2: Prepare Your Python Script (Backend)
            
            Create a Flask app to serve UMAP data and the HTML for the frontend:
            
            1. **Flask App Setup**:
            
            ```python
            from flask import Flask, jsonify, render_template
            import umap
            from sklearn.datasets import make_blobs
            
            app = Flask(__name__)
            
            # Generate sample data
            data1, _ = make_blobs(n_samples=100, centers=3, n_features=5, random_state=42)
            data2, _ = make_blobs(n_samples=100, centers=3, n_features=5, random_state=84)
            
            # Perform UMAP
            reducer1 = umap.UMAP()
            embedding1 = reducer1.fit_transform(data1)
            reducer2 = umap.UMAP()
            embedding2 = reducer2.fit_transform(data2)
            
            # Map indices
            feat_map = {i: (99-i) for i in range(100)}
            
            @app.route('/')
            def index():
                return render_template('index.html')
            
            @app.route('/data')
            def data():
                return jsonify({
                    'embedding1': embedding1.tolist(),
                    'embedding2': embedding2.tolist(),
                    'map': feat_map
                })
            
            if __name__ == '__main__':
                app.run(debug=True)
            
            ```
            
            1. **HTML and JavaScript (Frontend)**:
            Create a file `templates/index.html` in the same directory as your Flask app:
            
            ```html
            <!DOCTYPE html>
            <html>
            <head>
                <title>UMAP Visualizations</title>
                <script src="<https://cdn.plot.ly/plotly-latest.min.js>"></script>
            </head>
            <body>
                <div id="plot1" style="width:600px; height:500px;"></div>
                <div id="plot2" style="width:600px; height:500px;"></div>
            
                <script>
                    fetch('/data')
                        .then(response => response.json())
                        .then(data => {
                            const trace1 = {
                                x: data.embedding1.map(d => d[0]),
                                y: data.embedding1.map(d => d[1]),
                                mode: 'markers',
                                type: 'scatter',
                                text: Object.keys(data.map),
                                hoverinfo: 'text'
                            };
            
                            const trace2 = {
                                x: data.embedding2.map(d => d[0]),
                                y: data.embedding2.map(d => d[1]),
                                mode: 'markers',
                                type: 'scatter',
                                text: Object.values(data.map),
                                hoverinfo: 'text'
                            };
            
                            const layout = { hovermode: 'closest' };
            
                            Plotly.newPlot('plot1', [trace1], layout);
                            Plotly.newPlot('plot2', [trace2], layout);
            
                            const plots = [document.getElementById('plot1'), document.getElementById('plot2')];
            
                            plots.forEach((plot, index) => {
                                plot.on('plotly_hover', function(data) {
                                    let ptNumber = data.points[0].pointNumber;
                                    let mapIndex = index === 0 ? data.map[ptNumber] : Object.keys(data.map).find(key => data.map[key] === ptNumber);
                                    Plotly.Fx.hover(index === 0 ? 'plot2' : 'plot1', [{curveNumber: 0, pointNumber: mapIndex}], 'xy');
                                });
                            });
                        });
                </script>
            </body>
            </html>
            
            ```
            
            ### Step 3: Run Your Application
            
            Run the Flask app by executing `python <filename>.py`. Visit `localhost:5000` in your web browser to view the interactive UMAP plots.
            
            ### Summary:
            
            This setup allows for a high degree of interactivity by directly manipulating data on the client side with JavaScript. You can hover over points in one plot to highlight corresponding points in another plot, using Plotly.js for visualization and Flask for serving the data and the webpage. This method leverages the full capabilities of modern web technologies for interactive data visualization.

    - ✅ load embeddings and indices downloaded from colab (store in data folder)
    - ⚠️ debug why flask doesnt work
        
        this flask app doesn't show the plots side by side horizontally AND it's not highlighting the tokens, and using a feature map list such that the index in the list is the feature index in right plot and the value is feature index in left plot, such that the paired feature indices points in both plots are highlighted and display label when hovered over. modify the flask and html code to be more like this, with the above in mind:
        
    - ask ai to breakdown code and pinpoint part that does that function. if it doesn't, ask it how it can do it *(start from scratch so not polluted with prev wrong code!)*
        
        starting from side by side umap colab code, give it one step at a time, one small modification, rather than all at once
        
        - modify this code so that hovering over one point will turn it yellow
            - did not specify colab: [https://chatgpt.com/c/af24bff4-4390-49e8-b0de-99ff0359e5dd](https://chatgpt.com/c/af24bff4-4390-49e8-b0de-99ff0359e5dd)

    - ✅ NOTE: if get error `JSONDecodeError: Expecting value: line 69032 column 1 (char 3145728)`, prob bc file didn’t upload fully and was caneled. upload it again
    - ✅ modify this to color yellow the points features 1 and 3 in the left plot, and features 10 and 13 in the right plot, while all other points are blue:
        
        This works, but only visible when points are 16000. This is bc too many pts to see yellow! So perhaps instead of coloring, zoom in on both parts of the plots (neighborhood around the paired points) after hovering/clicking

    - correlation coefficient vs cca.score(X_umap, Y_umap)
        
        The `correlation coefficient` and `cca.score(X_umap, Y_umap)` are different methods to assess the relationship between the canonical variables obtained from Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA). Here's a breakdown of what each one represents and how to interpret them:
        
        ### Canonical Correlation Coefficient
        
        1. **Definition**: Canonical correlation coefficients measure the linear relationship between pairs of canonical variables obtained from the two datasets.
        2. **Calculation**: These coefficients are computed for each pair of canonical variables (one from each dataset). In your case, you computed the correlations manually:
            
            ```python
            correlations = [np.corrcoef(X_c[:, i], Y_c[:, i])[0, 1] for i in range(X_c.shape[1])]
            
            ```
            
        3. **Interpretation**:
            - Values range from -1 to 1.
            - A value closer to 1 or -1 indicates a strong linear relationship.
            - A value closer to 0 indicates a weak linear relationship.
            - Positive values indicate that as one variable increases, the other tends to increase.
            - Negative values indicate that as one variable increases, the other tends to decrease.
        
        ### `cca.score(X_umap, Y_umap)`
        
        1. **Definition**: The `cca.score` method in `sklearn` computes the average canonical correlation between the transformed datasets.
        2. **Calculation**: This method calculates the average correlation between the canonical variables across all dimensions specified during the CCA fitting. However, it should normally return a value between -1 and 1, indicating the average strength of the linear relationship.
        3. **Interpretation**:
            - A higher score indicates a stronger average linear relationship across all canonical pairs.
            - This method provides a single summary statistic instead of individual correlation coefficients for each pair.
        
        ### Practical Differences and Usage
        
        - **Granularity**: The canonical correlation coefficients provide a detailed view by showing the strength of the relationship for each pair of canonical variables. In contrast, `cca.score` gives a single summary measure of the overall relationship.
        - **Use Cases**:
            - **Canonical Correlation Coefficients**: Useful when you want to understand the relationship between specific pairs of canonical variables.
            - **cca.score**: Useful when you need a quick summary of the overall relationship strength.
        
        ### Example with Correct Usage
        
        Given your goal is to compare subspaces using CCA, here's how to properly use both methods:
        
        1. **Compute Canonical Correlation Coefficients**:
            
            ```python
            import numpy as np
            import umap
            from sklearn.cross_decomposition import CCA
            from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
            
            # Assuming X and Y are your input matrices of size (16384, 1024)
            # Assuming indices_X and indices_Y are lists of indices for subsetting X and Y respectively
            
            # Step 1: Subset the matrices
            X_subset = X[indices_X, :]
            Y_subset = Y[indices_Y, :]
            
            # Step 2: Apply UMAP to each subset
            umap_model = umap.UMAP(n_components=2)  # you can adjust n_components as needed
            
            X_umap = umap_model.fit_transform(X_subset)
            Y_umap = umap_model.fit_transform(Y_subset)
            
            # Standardize the UMAP-transformed data
            X_umap = StandardScaler().fit_transform(X_umap)
            Y_umap = StandardScaler().fit_transform(Y_umap)
            
            # Step 3: Fit and transform using CCA
            cca = CCA(n_components=2)  # you can adjust n_components as needed
            X_c, Y_c = cca.fit_transform(X_umap, Y_umap)
            
            # Calculate canonical correlations manually
            correlations = [np.corrcoef(X_c[:, i], Y_c[:, i])[0, 1] for i in range(X_c.shape[1])]
            print("Canonical correlations:", correlations)
            
            # Compute the average canonical correlation score
            average_score = np.mean(correlations)
            print("Average canonical correlation score:", average_score)
            
            ```
            
        2. **Compute `cca.score`**:
            
            ```python
            # Optionally, calculate the score using the CCA object
            cca_score = cca.score(X_umap, Y_umap)
            print("CCA score:", cca_score)
            
            ```
            
        
        ### Key Points to Remember:
        
        - Both the canonical correlation coefficients and `cca.score` are useful metrics, but they serve slightly different purposes.
        - Ensure the data is properly preprocessed (e.g., standardized) before applying CCA.
        - Interpret the canonical correlations to understand specific relationships, and use `cca.score` for a quick summary.
    - why is Average canonical correlation score 0.4 while cca.score(X_umap, Y_umap) is 0.1
        
        The discrepancy between the "Average canonical correlation score" (0.4) and `cca.score(X_umap, Y_umap)` (0.1) suggests a misunderstanding or misuse of the `cca.score` method. The `cca.score` method from scikit-learn's CCA class should give the average canonical correlation directly and should match the manually calculated average of the canonical correlations. Let's clarify and ensure the correct usage.
        
        ### Correct Usage and Understanding
        
        1. **Canonical Correlation Coefficients**:
            - These are manually computed correlations for each pair of canonical variables.
            - Should be directly calculated from the transformed data `X_c` and `Y_c`.
        2. **`cca.score` Method**:
            - This should return the average of the canonical correlations.
        
        ### Revisiting the Process and Code
        
        Let's ensure the entire process is correct:
        
        1. **Standardization**: Ensure data is standardized before applying UMAP and CCA.
        2. **UMAP Transformation**: Correctly transform the data using UMAP.
        3. **CCA Fitting and Transformation**: Correctly fit and transform the data using CCA.
        4. **Correlation Calculation**: Compute the canonical correlations correctly.
        5. **CCA Score Calculation**: Use `cca.score` method correctly.
        
        ### Complete Code Example
        
        Here is the corrected code with a focus on ensuring all steps are correctly performed:
        
        ```python
        import numpy as np
        import umap
        from sklearn.cross_decomposition import CCA
        from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
        
        # Assuming X and Y are your input matrices of size (16384, 1024)
        # Assuming indices_X and indices_Y are lists of indices for subsetting X and Y respectively
        
        # Step 1: Subset the matrices
        X_subset = X[indices_X, :]
        Y_subset = Y[indices_Y, :]
        
        # Step 2: Standardize the subsets
        scaler = StandardScaler()
        X_subset = scaler.fit_transform(X_subset)
        Y_subset = scaler.fit_transform(Y_subset)
        
        # Step 3: Apply UMAP to each subset
        umap_model = umap.UMAP(n_components=2)  # you can adjust n_components as needed
        
        X_umap = umap_model.fit_transform(X_subset)
        Y_umap = umap_model.fit_transform(Y_subset)
        
        # Step 4: Standardize the UMAP-transformed data
        X_umap = scaler.fit_transform(X_umap)
        Y_umap = scaler.fit_transform(Y_umap)
        
        # Step 5: Fit and transform using CCA
        cca = CCA(n_components=2)  # you can adjust n_components as needed
        X_c, Y_c = cca.fit_transform(X_umap, Y_umap)
        
        # Step 6: Calculate canonical correlations manually
        correlations = [np.corrcoef(X_c[:, i], Y_c[:, i])[0, 1] for i in range(X_c.shape[1])]
        print("Canonical correlations:", correlations)
        
        # Calculate the average canonical correlation score manually
        average_correlation_score = np.mean(correlations)
        print("Average canonical correlation score:", average_correlation_score)
        
        # Step 7: Compute the average canonical correlation score using CCA's score method
        cca_score = cca.score(X_umap, Y_umap)
        print("CCA score:", cca_score)
        
        ```
        
        ### Explanation of Steps:
        
        1. **Standardization**: The data is standardized before any dimensionality reduction. This ensures that each feature contributes equally to the analysis.
        2. **UMAP Transformation**: Apply UMAP to the standardized data to reduce dimensionality.
        3. **Standardization of UMAP Data**: Standardize the UMAP-transformed data.
        4. **CCA Fitting and Transformation**: Fit and transform the standardized UMAP data using CCA.
        5. **Correlation Calculation**: Manually compute the canonical correlations for each pair of canonical variables.
        6. **Average Correlation Calculation**: Calculate the average of the canonical correlations.
        7. **CCA Score Calculation**: Use the `cca.score` method to calculate the average canonical correlation score.
        
        ### Consistency Check:
        
        - The manually calculated average canonical correlation should match the `cca.score`.
        - If there's still a discrepancy, double-check the input data and ensure no preprocessing steps were missed.
        
        ### Troubleshooting:
        
        If the `cca.score` still does not match the average of manually calculated correlations, check for potential issues such as:
        
        - Misalignment or indexing errors in the data subsets.
        - Ensure all data preprocessing steps are consistent between manual and method-based calculations.
        - Verify there are no NaNs or infinities in the data after transformations.
        
        By following these steps and ensuring correct preprocessing, the manually calculated average canonical correlation should match the `cca.score`.
        
    - i don't get why cca.score is done on embeddings before doing cca.transform?
        
        
        The `cca.score` method works directly on the embeddings (`embedding1` and `embedding2`) because it encapsulates both the transformation and the correlation computation in one step. Here’s the process:
        
    - high cca score, low corr coeffs
        
        The output suggests that there are issues with the canonical correlation analysis (CCA) results, indicated by the highly negative canonical correlation and the extremely low correlation coefficients. Here’s a breakdown of what these values mean and possible reasons for these results:
        
        ### Breakdown of the Results
        
        1. **Canonical Correlations: -0.9934121981814538**
            - This value indicates a very strong inverse relationship between the canonical variates of the transformed data sets.
            - In a typical CCA, such a strong negative correlation is unusual and might indicate an issue with the data preprocessing or the fitting process.
        2. **Correlation Coefficients: [0.0038447374325681206, 0.0021137853358469474]**
            - These values represent the correlation coefficients for the individual components of the transformed data sets.
            - The extremely low values (close to zero) suggest that there is almost no linear relationship between the corresponding canonical variates for these components.
        
        ### Interpretation and Possible Issues
        
        The combination of a highly negative canonical correlation and near-zero correlation coefficients indicates that something might have gone wrong during the CCA process. Here are some potential issues and interpretations:
        
        1. **Data Preprocessing**:
            - Ensure that the data is properly scaled and standardized before applying CCA. Inconsistent or incorrect scaling can lead to misleading results.
            - Double-check that the subsets or embeddings (e.g., `embedding1` and `embedding2`) are correctly derived and transformed.
        2. **Dimensionality Reduction Step**:
            - If UMAP or another dimensionality reduction technique was applied, verify that the parameters used are appropriate and that the resulting embeddings maintain meaningful relationships.
            - Non-linear transformations like UMAP can sometimes distort linear relationships, which can affect the CCA results.
        3. **Fit and Transform Steps**:
            - Ensure that the CCA model is correctly fitted to the data before scoring or transforming.
            - Double-check the order of operations and ensure consistency between fitting, transforming, and scoring.
        4. **Canonical Variates Interpretation**:
            - The strong negative correlation combined with low individual correlation coefficients might indicate overfitting or that the canonical variates are not capturing meaningful relationships.
        
        ### Suggestions for Troubleshooting
        
        To diagnose and address the issue, you might consider the following steps:
        
        1. **Verify Data Integrity**:
            - Check the integrity and preprocessing of the original data before applying CCA.
            - Ensure that there are no errors or anomalies in the data subsets used for CCA.
        2. **Review Dimensionality Reduction**:
            - Experiment with different parameters for UMAP or try alternative dimensionality reduction techniques (e.g., PCA) to see if the results improve.
        3. **Check CCA Implementation**:
            - Confirm that the CCA model is correctly fitted and transformed.
            - Ensure that the data passed to `cca.score` and `cca.transform` is consistent and correctly preprocessed.
        4. **Recalculate Step-by-Step**:
            - Manually calculate the canonical correlations step-by-step to identify where the discrepancy arises.
            - Compare the manual calculations with the results from the `cca.score` method.
        
        Here’s a revised and more detailed approach to fitting, transforming, and scoring the CCA model:
        
        ```python
        from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
        from sklearn.cross_decomposition import CCA
        import numpy as np
        
        # Assuming embedding1 and embedding2 are the UMAP-transformed embeddings
        
        # Step 1: Standardize the embeddings
        scaler = StandardScaler()
        embedding1 = scaler.fit_transform(embedding1)
        embedding2 = scaler.fit_transform(embedding2)
        
        # Step 2: Fit the CCA model
        cca = CCA(n_components=2)
        cca.fit(embedding1, embedding2)
        
        # Step 3: Transform the data
        A_c, B_c = cca.transform(embedding1, embedding2)
        
        # Step 4: Calculate canonical correlations manually
        canonical_correlations = [np.corrcoef(A_c[:, i], B_c[:, i])[0, 1] for i in range(A_c.shape[1])]
        print("Canonical Correlations (manual):", canonical_correlations)
        
        # Step 5: Compute the average canonical correlation score manually
        average_correlation_score = np.mean(canonical_correlations)
        print("Average Canonical Correlation Score (manual):", average_correlation_score)
        
        # Step 6: Compute the CCA score using the score method
        cca_score = cca.score(embedding1, embedding2)
        print("CCA Score:", cca_score)
        
        ```
        
        By following these steps and verifying each stage, you can identify potential issues and better understand the resulting canonical correlations.
        
    - is it valid to apply umap then cca; is it better to just apply cca on original data
        
        Applying UMAP followed by CCA can be valid depending on the specific goals and characteristics of your data. However, whether this approach is better than applying CCA directly on the original data depends on several factors. Let's discuss the considerations for both approaches.
        
        ### Applying UMAP Followed by CCA
        
        ### Advantages:
        
        1. **Dimensionality Reduction**:
            - UMAP is a powerful non-linear dimensionality reduction technique that can uncover complex structures in the data, potentially making it easier for CCA to find meaningful relationships in a lower-dimensional space.
        2. **Noise Reduction**:
            - By reducing the dimensionality, UMAP can help filter out noise and highlight the most significant features, which might improve the performance of subsequent analyses like CCA.
        3. **Visualization**:
            - UMAP provides a way to visualize high-dimensional data in 2D or 3D, which can help in understanding the underlying structure and relationships before applying CCA.
        
        ### Disadvantages:
        
        1. **Non-Linear Transformation**:
            - UMAP is a non-linear method, which means that the relationships between variables in the original high-dimensional space may not be preserved in the lower-dimensional space. This can affect the interpretability of the canonical correlations obtained from CCA.
        2. **Loss of Information**:
            - Dimensionality reduction techniques can sometimes lose important information, especially if the reduced dimensions are not sufficient to capture the complexity of the data.
        
        ### Applying CCA Directly on Original Data
        
        ### Advantages:
        
        1. **Linear Relationships**:
            - CCA is a linear method that identifies linear relationships between two datasets. Applying it directly to the original data ensures that these relationships are based on the full information present in the data.
        2. **Interpretability**:
            - The canonical variates obtained from CCA on the original data are easier to interpret in terms of the original variables.
        
        ### Disadvantages:
        
        1. **High Dimensionality**:
            - If the original data is high-dimensional, CCA might struggle due to the curse of dimensionality, where the large number of variables can lead to overfitting and poor generalization.
        2. **Noise**:
            - High-dimensional data often contains noise, which can obscure the meaningful relationships that CCA is trying to uncover.
        
        ### Recommendations
        
        1. **Exploratory Analysis**:
            - Use UMAP for exploratory data analysis and visualization to understand the structure of your data. This can help in identifying the most relevant features and understanding the relationships before applying CCA.
        2. **Apply CCA Directly**:
            - If interpretability and preserving linear relationships are crucial, consider applying CCA directly on the original data, especially if the dimensionality is manageable.
        3. **Hybrid Approach**:
            - Consider a hybrid approach where you first use UMAP to reduce dimensionality to a level that is still interpretable and then apply CCA. This can balance the benefits of noise reduction and visualization from UMAP with the interpretability of CCA.
        
        ### Example Code for Both Approaches
        
        ### 1. Applying CCA Directly on Original Data:
        
        ```python
        from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
        from sklearn.cross_decomposition import CCA
        
        # Assuming X and Y are your original input matrices
        scaler = StandardScaler()
        X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)
        Y_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(Y)
        
        cca = CCA(n_components=2)
        cca.fit(X_scaled, Y_scaled)
        
        A_c, B_c = cca.transform(X_scaled, Y_scaled)
        
        # Calculate canonical correlations
        canonical_correlations = [np.corrcoef(A_c[:, i], B_c[:, i])[0, 1] for i in range(A_c.shape[1])]
        print("Canonical Correlations (direct CCA):", canonical_correlations)
        
        cca_score = cca.score(X_scaled, Y_scaled)
        print("CCA Score (direct CCA):", cca_score)
        
        ```
        
        ### 2. Applying UMAP Followed by CCA:
        
        ```python
        import umap
        from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
        from sklearn.cross_decomposition import CCA
        
        # Assuming X and Y are your original input matrices
        scaler = StandardScaler()
        X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)
        Y_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(Y)
        
        umap_model = umap.UMAP(n_components=2)
        X_umap = umap_model.fit_transform(X_scaled)
        Y_umap = umap_model.fit_transform(Y_scaled)
        
        cca = CCA(n_components=2)
        cca.fit(X_umap, Y_umap)
        
        A_c, B_c = cca.transform(X_umap, Y_umap)
        
        # Calculate canonical correlations
        canonical_correlations = [np.corrcoef(A_c[:, i], B_c[:, i])[0, 1] for i in range(A_c.shape[1])]
        print("Canonical Correlations (UMAP + CCA):", canonical_correlations)
        
        cca_score = cca.score(X_umap, Y_umap)
        print("CCA Score (UMAP + CCA):", cca_score)
        
        ```
        
        ### Conclusion
        
        Choosing between applying UMAP followed by CCA or applying CCA directly to the original data depends on your specific data characteristics and analysis goals. Both approaches have their merits and potential pitfalls, so it's often useful to experiment with both and compare the results to determine which method provides more meaningful and interpretable insights for your particular use case.
        
    - does using a100 speed up plotting or cca calc in colab
        
        Using an A100 GPU in Google Colab can significantly speed up certain computations, particularly those that involve large-scale matrix operations or parallelizable tasks. However, the specific impact on plotting and Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) depends on how these tasks are implemented and whether they are optimized to leverage GPU acceleration. Let's break this down:
        
        ### Speed Up Plotting
        
        1. **Plotting Libraries**:
            - Most common plotting libraries in Python, such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly, do not typically utilize GPU acceleration. These libraries are primarily CPU-bound and might not see a significant speed improvement with a GPU like the A100.
            - Tasks like rendering plots, updating figures, and managing graphical user interface (GUI) elements are generally handled by the CPU.
        
        ### Speed Up CCA Calculations
        
        1. **Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)**:
            - CCA involves linear algebra operations, which can be accelerated on a GPU. Libraries that leverage GPU acceleration for linear algebra, such as CuPy (a GPU-accelerated drop-in replacement for NumPy) or RAPIDS cuML, can significantly speed up these computations.
            - Scikit-learn, the library typically used for CCA in Python, does not natively support GPU acceleration for CCA. However, you can use GPU-accelerated libraries to perform similar analyses.
        
        ### Example of GPU-Accelerated Linear Algebra for CCA
        
        To use GPU-accelerated linear algebra operations for something similar to CCA, you can use CuPy along with RAPIDS cuML. Here's an example:
        
        ```python
        # Install RAPIDS if not already installed
        !pip install -q rapids-cuml
        
        import cupy as cp
        from cuml import CCA
        
        # Assuming X and Y are your original input matrices on GPU
        X_gpu = cp.asarray(X)
        Y_gpu = cp.asarray(Y)
        
        # Standardize the data
        X_gpu = (X_gpu - cp.mean(X_gpu, axis=0)) / cp.std(X_gpu, axis=0)
        Y_gpu = (Y_gpu - cp.mean(Y_gpu, axis=0)) / cp.std(Y_gpu, axis=0)
        
        # Perform CCA using RAPIDS cuML
        cca_gpu = CCA(n_components=2)
        cca_gpu.fit(X_gpu, Y_gpu)
        
        A_c_gpu, B_c_gpu = cca_gpu.transform(X_gpu, Y_gpu)
        
        # Transfer results back to CPU for further processing if needed
        A_c = cp.asnumpy(A_c_gpu)
        B_c = cp.asnumpy(B_c_gpu)
        
        # Calculate canonical correlations manually
        canonical_correlations = [np.corrcoef(A_c[:, i], B_c[:, i])[0, 1] for i in range(A_c.shape[1])]
        print("Canonical Correlations (GPU CCA):", canonical_correlations)
        
        ```
        
        ### Conclusion
        
        - **Plotting**: Using an A100 GPU will not significantly speed up plotting tasks in most common Python plotting libraries since they are CPU-bound.
        - **CCA Calculations**: The A100 GPU can speed up CCA calculations if you use GPU-accelerated libraries such as RAPIDS cuML. For CCA in scikit-learn, the computations will remain CPU-bound unless you switch to a library that leverages GPU acceleration.
        
        Therefore, to leverage the A100 GPU for CCA in Google Colab, consider using GPU-accelerated libraries designed for linear algebra and machine learning tasks.
        
    - due to umap randomness does that mean cca score on umap embeddings is diff each time
        
        Yes, the Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) score on UMAP embeddings can differ each time due to the inherent randomness in UMAP's algorithm. UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) uses stochastic processes, including random initializations and stochastic gradient descent, which can lead to slightly different embeddings on each run unless you set a fixed random seed.
        
        ### Understanding UMAP's Randomness
        
        1. **Stochastic Nature**:
            - UMAP relies on stochastic processes to construct the high-dimensional graph and then optimize the low-dimensional representation.
            - This can introduce variability in the resulting embeddings across different runs.
        2. **Random Initialization**:
            - The initial positions of points in the lower-dimensional space are randomly set, which can influence the final outcome.
        3. **Optimization**:
            - The optimization process in UMAP is non-deterministic, further contributing to the variability in embeddings.
        
        ### Impact on CCA
        
        When you apply CCA to the embeddings generated by UMAP, the variability in the embeddings can lead to different canonical correlations and, consequently, different CCA scores each time UMAP is run.
        
        ### Mitigating Variability
        
        To mitigate the variability and make the results reproducible, you can set a fixed random seed for UMAP. This ensures that the random processes within UMAP produce the same results each time.
        
        ### Setting a Random Seed in UMAP
        
        Here’s how you can set a random seed in UMAP to ensure reproducible embeddings:
        
        ```python
        import umap
        from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
        from sklearn.cross_decomposition import CCA
        import numpy as np
        
        # Assuming X and Y are your original input matrices
        scaler = StandardScaler()
        X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)
        Y_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(Y)
        
        # Set a fixed random seed for UMAP
        random_state = 42  # You can choose any integer
        
        umap_model = umap.UMAP(n_components=2, random_state=random_state)
        X_umap = umap_model.fit_transform(X_scaled)
        Y_umap = umap_model.fit_transform(Y_scaled)
        
        # Fit the CCA model
        cca = CCA(n_components=2)
        cca.fit(X_umap, Y_umap)
        
        # Transform the data
        A_c, B_c = cca.transform(X_umap, Y_umap)
        
        # Calculate canonical correlations manually
        canonical_correlations = [np.corrcoef(A_c[:, i], B_c[:, i])[0, 1] for i in range(A_c.shape[1])]
        print("Canonical Correlations (UMAP + CCA):", canonical_correlations)
        
        # Compute the CCA score
        cca_score = cca.score(X_umap, Y_umap)
        print("CCA Score (UMAP + CCA):", cca_score)
        
        ```
        
        ### Summary
        
        - **Variability**: UMAP's randomness can lead to different embeddings, affecting the CCA scores.
        - **Reproducibility**: Setting a fixed random seed in UMAP ensures reproducible embeddings and consistent CCA scores across runs.
        - **Implementation**: Use the `random_state` parameter in UMAP to control the randomness.
        
        By setting a random seed, you can ensure that the results of your UMAP and subsequent CCA analyses are reproducible and consistent each time you run the code.

        - coefficient of det vs mean of canon coeff
            
            The coefficient of determination (R²) and the mean of canonical correlation coefficients are two different metrics used to evaluate Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA). Here’s a detailed comparison and explanation of these metrics:
            
            ### Coefficient of Determination (R²)
            
            The coefficient of determination, or R², measures how well the canonical variates from one dataset can predict the canonical variates from the other dataset. This is akin to evaluating the goodness-of-fit of a regression model.
            
            - **Definition**: R² is the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable(s).
            - **Computation in CCA**: When using the `cca.score` method in scikit-learn, R² is calculated as the proportion of variance in the canonical variates of Y that can be explained by the canonical variates of X.
            - **Range**: R² ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 indicates no predictive power and 1 indicates perfect prediction.
            
            ### Mean of Canonical Correlation Coefficients
            
            Canonical correlation coefficients measure the linear relationships between pairs of canonical variates derived from the two datasets.
            
            - **Definition**: Canonical correlation coefficients are the Pearson correlation coefficients between the pairs of canonical variates.
            - **Computation in CCA**: After transforming the data using CCA, canonical correlations are calculated for each pair of canonical variates.
            - **Mean Canonical Correlation**: The mean of these coefficients gives an overall sense of the linear relationship strength between the datasets.
            
            ### Example Calculation of Both Metrics
            
            Here’s an example showing how to calculate both the coefficient of determination (R²) and the mean of canonical correlation coefficients using scikit-learn’s CCA:
            
            ```python
            from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
            from sklearn.cross_decomposition import CCA
            import numpy as np
            
            # Example data
            X = np.random.rand(100, 10)
            Y = np.random.rand(100, 10)
            
            # Standardize the data
            scaler = StandardScaler()
            X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)
            Y_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(Y)
            
            # Apply CCA
            cca = CCA(n_components=2)
            cca.fit(X_scaled, Y_scaled)
            
            # Transform the data
            X_c, Y_c = cca.transform(X_scaled, Y_scaled)
            
            # Calculate canonical correlations manually
            canonical_correlations = [np.corrcoef(X_c[:, i], Y_c[:, i])[0, 1] for i in range(X_c.shape[1])]
            print("Canonical Correlations:", canonical_correlations)
            
            # Compute the mean of canonical correlations
            mean_canonical_correlation = np.mean(canonical_correlations)
            print("Mean Canonical Correlation:", mean_canonical_correlation)
            
            # Compute the CCA score (coefficient of determination)
            cca_score = cca.score(X_scaled, Y_scaled)
            print("CCA Score (R²):", cca_score)
            
            ```
            
            ### Interpretation of Results
            
            1. **Canonical Correlations**:
                - Each value in `canonical_correlations` represents the strength of the linear relationship between a pair of canonical variates from `X` and `Y`.
                - The mean canonical correlation provides an average measure of these relationships.
            2. **CCA Score (R²)**:
                - The CCA score represents how well the canonical variates of `X` predict the canonical variates of `Y`.
                - This score is a measure of the overall predictive power of the canonical relationship.
            
            ### Choosing Between the Metrics
            
            - **Coefficient of Determination (R²)**:
                - Use this if you are interested in the predictive power of the canonical variates. It tells you how well one set of canonical variates predicts the other.
                - Useful for assessing the explanatory power of the model.
            - **Mean Canonical Correlation**:
                - Use this if you are more interested in the average strength of the linear relationships between the canonical variates.
                - Provides a direct measure of the correlation strength.
            
            Both metrics are valuable, but they serve different purposes. The choice between them depends on whether your primary interest lies in prediction (R²) or in measuring the strength of associations (mean canonical correlation).

    - [what's the diffeence between fit and transform](https://chatgpt.com/c/a0b74b21-ff52-481e-a5f0-ed437df3f437)
    - so you need fit before transform? can't use score before transform?
        
        Yes, you need to call `fit` before `transform` when using most machine learning models, including Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA). This is because `fit` is the step where the model learns the necessary parameters based on the input data. Without fitting the model first, the `transform` method wouldn't know how to process the input data.
        
        ### Sequence of Operations
        
        1. **Fit:**
            - `cca.fit(X1_sc, X2_sc)`
            - This step is mandatory. It computes the parameters needed for transformation, which in the case of CCA, are the weights for the linear combinations that maximize the correlation between the datasets.
        2. **Transform:**
            - `X1_c, X2_c = cca.transform(X1_sc, X2_sc)`
            - After fitting, this step applies the learned transformation to the input data, projecting it into the canonical variates space.
        
        ### Using `score` Method
        
        In many machine learning models, there is also a `score` method that evaluates the performance of the model. However, in the context of CCA, the `score` method might not be directly applicable or may not exist. If it does exist, it would typically require the model to be fit first.
        
        - **Score (if applicable):**
            - `cca.score(X1_sc, X2_sc)`
            - This method, if available, would evaluate the model's performance based on some criterion (e.g., correlation strength in the case of CCA). However, it assumes that the model has already been fitted.
        
        ### Summary
        
        - **Fit:** Mandatory initial step to learn the model parameters.
        - **Transform:** Requires the model to be fitted first. Applies the learned transformation to the data.
        - **Score:** If available, usually requires the model to be fitted and might evaluate the model's performance.
        
        In conclusion, you cannot use `transform` or `score` before `fit` because the model needs to learn the necessary parameters during the fitting process before it can transform the data or evaluate its performance.

        - are they learning the same subspace? how to measure in high dim?
        - difference if use top k? number of examples? make table for saes to train.
    - which features appear to be frequently learned across models using same dataset?
        - which ways that features split appear to be frequently done?
        - are they learning the same high dim relations?
        - conditions for saes which show more similarity between two models

            - NOTE: acts is used to calc dataset exmps, but takes up many gbs
            - we can rewrite the fns to use reshaped actvs instead! all we have to do is not do reshape(-1) to flatten it
        - ✅ ALT: instead of compute entire matrix, for each feature in B, get row of all corrs with every feature in A, then keep only top ind and delete this row. Save and repeat for all features in B. Or instead of “each feature”, do it for small batch of features.

    - ✅ ⚠️ get top highest corr pairs, and interpret
        - DEBUG: this is incorrect. highest_correlations_values shuld be the same len as highest_correlations_indices, and contains the value of the corr betwen index (B) and mapped index (A). Instead, it contains every batch value, not just the highest pair!

            - actually, the weights aren’t combined at all! we can get a reducer, and run the same reducer on all 3 weights, then plot them?

                    - does it matter if we initalize the reducer in two different instances but with same parameters?
                        
                        Yes, it does matter if you initialize the reducer in two different instances, even with the same parameters, because the UMAP algorithm involves stochastic processes such as initialization and optimization steps that can lead to different results. By using two different reducer instances, you can get slightly different embeddings even if the parameters are the same.
                        
                        Here's a more detailed explanation:
                        
                        ### Stochastic Nature of UMAP
                        
                        UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) involves stochastic optimization, meaning that random initialization and random choices during optimization can lead to different embeddings each time you run it. Parameters such as the number of neighbors (`n_neighbors`), minimum distance (`min_dist`), and the metric (`metric`) set the structure of the UMAP algorithm, but the random seed affects the initialization and convergence of the algorithm.
                        
                        ### Consistent Embeddings
                        
                        If you want consistent embeddings across different datasets:
                        
                        - **Use the same reducer instance**: Fit the reducer on a combined dataset and then transform each dataset.
                        - **Set a random seed**: Initialize the reducer with a fixed random seed to ensure reproducibility.
                        
                        Here is an example:
                        
                        ```python
                        import umap
                        import numpy as np
                        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
                        
                        # Example datasets
                        data1 = np.random.rand(100, 10)
                        data2 = np.random.rand(100, 10)
                        data3 = np.random.rand(100, 10)
                        
                        # Combine datasets
                        combined_data = np.vstack((data1, data2, data3))
                        
                        # Create and fit UMAP reducer on combined dataset with a fixed random seed
                        reducer = umap.UMAP(n_neighbors=15, min_dist=0.01, metric='euclidean', random_state=42)
                        reducer.fit(combined_data)
                        
                        # Transform each dataset using the same reducer
                        embedding1 = reducer.transform(data1)
                        embedding2 = reducer.transform(data2)
                        embedding3 = reducer.transform(data3)
                        
                        # Plot the embeddings
                        plt.figure(figsize=(12, 4))
                        
                        plt.subplot(1, 3, 1)
                        plt.scatter(embedding1[:, 0], embedding1[:, 1], label='Dataset 1')
                        plt.title('Dataset 1')
                        plt.legend()
                        
                        plt.subplot(1, 3, 2)
                        plt.scatter(embedding2[:, 0], embedding2[:, 1], label='Dataset 2')
                        plt.title('Dataset 2')
                        plt.legend()
                        
                        plt.subplot(1, 3, 3)
                        plt.scatter(embedding3[:, 0], embedding3[:, 1], label='Dataset 3')
                        plt.title('Dataset 3')
                        plt.legend()
                        
                        plt.tight_layout()
                        plt.show()
                        
                        ```
                        
                        ### Using Two Different Reducer Instances
                        
                        If you use two different reducer instances with the same parameters but without fixing the random seed, the embeddings might look similar but will not be identical:
                        
                        ```python
                        # Create two separate UMAP reducers with the same parameters
                        reducer1 = umap.UMAP(n_neighbors=15, min_dist=0.01, metric='euclidean')
                        reducer2 = umap.UMAP(n_neighbors=15, min_dist=0.01, metric='euclidean')
                        
                        # Fit and transform each dataset separately
                        embedding1 = reducer1.fit_transform(data1)
                        embedding2 = reducer2.fit_transform(data2)
                        
                        # These embeddings are not guaranteed to be in the same space
                        
                        # Plot the embeddings
                        plt.figure(figsize=(8, 4))
                        
                        plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
                        plt.scatter(embedding1[:, 0], embedding1[:, 1], label='Dataset 1')
                        plt.title('Dataset 1')
                        plt.legend()
                        
                        plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)
                        plt.scatter(embedding2[:, 0], embedding2[:, 1], label='Dataset 2')
                        plt.title('Dataset 2')
                        plt.legend()
                        
                        plt.tight_layout()
                        plt.show()
                        
                        ```
                        
                        In summary, for comparable and consistent embeddings across different datasets, it is crucial to use the same reducer instance and ideally set a random seed for reproducibility.

        - we find that the upons from both models ARE in the same place, just hard to see unless zoomed in. however, this is just ‘upon’, so too specific already, and we don’t see feature splitting

    - now plot 3 in the same plot (1L_16k, 1L_32k, and 2L-16k)
- in umap python, difference between reducer.transform and reducer.fit
    
    In UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection), `reducer.fit` and `reducer.transform` serve different purposes and are used at different stages of the dimensionality reduction process.
    
    ### `reducer.fit`
    
    - **Purpose**: This method is used to learn the embedding from the training data. It performs the dimensionality reduction by fitting the UMAP model to the data.
    - **Usage**: Use `reducer.fit` when you want to train the UMAP model on a given dataset.
    - **Functionality**: It computes the low-dimensional embedding for the training data. After fitting, the UMAP model captures the structure of the data in the lower-dimensional space.
    - **Code Example**:
        
        ```python
        import umap
        
        # Create UMAP object
        reducer = umap.UMAP(n_neighbors=15, min_dist=0.1, n_components=2)
        
        # Fit the model to the data
        reducer.fit(X_train)
        
        ```
        
    
    ### `reducer.transform`
    
    - **Purpose**: This method is used to map new data points into the existing low-dimensional space learned by `reducer.fit`.
    - **Usage**: Use `reducer.transform` when you have already fitted the UMAP model on the training data and now want to transform new data points into the same lower-dimensional space.
    - **Functionality**: It takes the fitted UMAP model and projects new data points onto the pre-learned embedding space without altering the learned structure.
    - **Code Example**:
        
        ```python
        # Assuming the UMAP model has already been fitted
        X_new_transformed = reducer.transform(X_new)
        
        ```
        
    
    ### Example Workflow
    
    1. **Fit the model on the training data**:
        
        ```python
        import umap
        
        # Create UMAP object
        reducer = umap.UMAP(n_neighbors=15, min_dist=0.1, n_components=2)
        
        # Fit the model to the training data
        reducer.fit(X_train)
        
        ```
        
    2. **Transform new data points using the fitted model**:
        
        ```python
        # Transform new data points
        X_new_transformed = reducer.transform(X_new)
        
        ```
        
    
    ### Key Points
    
    - **`reducer.fit`** is for learning the embedding from the training data.
    - **`reducer.transform`** is for projecting new data into the learned embedding space.
    - Use `fit` when you want to create the model, and `transform` when you want to apply the model to new data.
    
    By separating these steps, UMAP allows for efficient use of the learned embedding, enabling you to apply the same transformation to multiple datasets once the model has been trained.
    
- ask neuronpedia if they have feature splitting umaps
    
    1) I was wondering if Neuronpedia has ways for users to plot the combined set of feature directions from SAEs of different widths (such as the set of GPT-2 feature splitting SAEs), as seen in the attached plot from “Towards Monosemanticity”? If not, I saw in the last update that UMAPs for all SAEs are being generated and perhaps this might be a future update.
    
    2) I’ve been performing UMAP plotting combined feature directions from SAEs of different widths trained on tinystories models by first learning the embedding on all the feature directions (decoder weights stacked row-wise), then transforming each SAE’s weights into the new lower-dim space (coloured by SAE dict width). Would this be the right way to reproduce Anthropic’s plots?
    
    3) If the feature splitting UMAPs aren’t present for now, I was looking to put the pre-trained GPT-2 SM L8 decoder weights and the exportable explanations into an interactive UMAP plot. While I find many highly correlated features in the tinystories SAEs, the feature splitting is not as prominent; it may be due to how I train the SAEs, so I might find better results with the pretrained SAEs.  If anyone else is exploring this, such as with training better SAEs on tinystories GPT-2 models, I would be interested in talking more about it!

Train SAEs to learn specific, separate royal family features

- PLAN: our tools (corr, dataset exmps, umap, etc) have been shown to work. now, we need better datasets and models that show fs
    - once get better saes with fs concepts, color code multiple concepts- king queen princess- and check their relations across models
        - train on that specific data, on large sae, to ensure it learns them separately

- umap plot pretrained gpt2 fs- sanity check, should match neuronpedia
- plot corr actv plots for feature split (or corr features)
- how to detect feature splitting, not just from umaps
    - get top 10 more corr from A to B, vice versa
- take most similar vectors and autolabel how similar their dataset examples are, rather than doing it manually
    - without chatgpt: +1 to score if contains same token in top 5, OR get how many of their top 5 tokens have same tokens
- in actv corr plot, show the dataset examples when hovering that are nonzero
- given corr feature pair, zoom-in on the umap of both
- compare MLP 1
- compare tinystories gpt2 to pretrained gpt2
- 🐣 neuronpedia: you can download the labels for their pretrained to use it yourself

- before using cca, filter out features better
- cca on feature actvs
- mutual NN on weights and actvs? no; can only do on inputs (tokens)
    - if pts are features, perhaps we can’t use mnn. only makes sense if we plot the tokens in a projected down feature space.
        - indeed, algtop was applied on input pts, NOT neurons as pts! same with activation atlas!

- plot feature subset
- use multiple keywords, each with different color
- instead of color, put a label box around the points in each plot

- in a box outside plot, display the other model’s pair
- compare subspace scores to random subspace pairs. ask chatgpt for how to better stat tests
- Then, higher-order graphs of keyword subspaces. It’s not enough to just plot the subspace of Dragon to subspace of Dragon; it’s the subspace of {Dragon, Princess}, as that’s relation of Dragon to Princess. Or {he, she}

- [I understand negative correlation between two variables. But what does negative CCA mean between two spaces of datapoints?](https://chatgpt.com/c/00acbbcb-2454-4246-a90c-33a4de7067e4)
    
    Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) is a method used to understand the relationship between two sets of multidimensional variables. When we talk about a negative canonical correlation, we're referring to the relationship between linear combinations of these sets of variables. Let's break this down:
    
    1. **CCA Basics**: In CCA, we have two sets of variables (let's call them \(\mathbf{X}\) and \(\mathbf{Y}\)). The goal of CCA is to find linear combinations of \(\mathbf{X}\) and \(\mathbf{Y}\) that are maximally correlated. Specifically, we seek vectors \( \mathbf{a} \) and \( \mathbf{b} \) such that the correlation between \( \mathbf{a}^T \mathbf{X} \) and \( \mathbf{b}^T \mathbf{Y} \) is maximized.
    2. **Canonical Correlation**: The canonical correlation is the correlation coefficient between these linear combinations. This correlation can be positive or negative. A positive canonical correlation indicates that when one set of variables increases, the other set tends to increase as well. Conversely, a negative canonical correlation indicates that when one set of variables increases, the other set tends to decrease.
    3. **Negative Canonical Correlation**:
        - When the canonical correlation is negative, it implies an inverse relationship between the linear combinations of the two sets of variables. In other words, the higher values of the linear combination of one set of variables (\(\mathbf{a}^T \mathbf{X}\)) are associated with lower values of the linear combination of the other set (\(\mathbf{b}^T \mathbf{Y}\)), and vice versa.
        - For example, if \(\mathbf{a}^T \mathbf{X}\) represents a particular weighted sum of the variables in \(\mathbf{X}\) and \(\mathbf{b}^T \mathbf{Y}\) represents a weighted sum of the variables in \(\mathbf{Y}\), a negative canonical correlation would mean that when the weighted sum in \(\mathbf{X}\) increases, the weighted sum in \(\mathbf{Y}\) tends to decrease.
    4. **Interpretation**: In practical terms, a negative canonical correlation suggests that there is an inverse relationship between certain linear features of the two datasets. Understanding this can help in fields such as finance (e.g., where one portfolio might hedge against another), biology (e.g., where certain gene expressions might inversely relate to others), and more.
    
    ### Example
    
    Suppose we have two sets of variables:
    
    - \(\mathbf{X}\): Economic indicators (e.g., interest rates, unemployment rates, GDP growth).
    - \(\mathbf{Y}\): Stock market indicators (e.g., stock prices, market indices, trading volumes).
    
    If we perform CCA and find a negative canonical correlation, it could mean that a particular linear combination of economic indicators (e.g., a scenario where interest rates and unemployment rates are high) is inversely related to a linear combination of stock market indicators (e.g., lower stock prices and trading volumes).
    
    In summary, negative CCA means that there is an inverse relationship between the optimal linear combinations of the two datasets, indicating that as one combination increases, the other tends to decrease. This can provide insights into the underlying structure and relationship between the two sets of variables.

    - if the elements in the plot given from the paper are weights, how are the labels like Monday derived?
        
        The labels like "Monday" in the PCA plot are derived from the specific clustering of dictionary elements corresponding to days of the week, as discovered through the use of sparse autoencoders (SAEs) on language model hidden states. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the process:
        
        1. **Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs)**: SAEs are trained to decompose model hidden states into sparse vector sums from an over-complete basis. This means they can identify dictionary elements (features) that are activated by the model.
        2. **Clustering**: The dictionary elements identified by the SAEs are clustered based on their pairwise cosine similarity or Jaccard similarity. This clustering helps in grouping together elements that represent similar concepts or features.
        3. **Multi-dimensional Features**: The clusters that emerge from this process often represent multi-dimensional features, such as the circular patterns observed for days of the week. These clusters are then analyzed to ensure they are not mixtures or separable into lower-dimensional features, making them irreducible multi-dimensional features.
        4. **Interpretation**: Each cluster is interpreted and labeled according to the tokens that predominantly activate the dictionary elements in that cluster. For example, a cluster of dictionary elements that are primarily activated by tokens corresponding to "Monday" will be labeled as such.
        5. **Visualization with PCA**: PCA is used to reduce the dimensionality of these multi-dimensional features for visualization purposes. The resulting plot shows distinct clusters corresponding to the days of the week, which are labeled accordingly.
        
        In summary, the labels like "Monday" are derived by clustering the dictionary elements found by SAEs, which are then analyzed and interpreted based on the tokens that activate them, and visualized using PCA to show the circular representation of the days of the week.
        
    - cite the lines in the paper  that made you derive:
        
        The lines in the paper that support the interpretation and labeling of clusters according to the tokens that predominantly activate the dictionary elements in that cluster are:
        
        1. "This suggests a natural approach to using sparse autoencoders to search for irreducible multi-dimensional features:
            1. Cluster dictionary elements by their pairwise cosine similarity or Jaccard similarity.
            2. For each cluster, run the SAEs on all xi,l ∈ Xi,l and ablate all dictionary elements not in the cluster. This will give the reconstruction of each xi,l restricted to the cluster found in step 1 (if no cluster dictionary elements are non-zero for a given point, we ignore the point).
            3. Examine the resulting reconstructed activation vectors for irreducible multi-dimensional features, especially ensuring that the reconstruction is not separable. This step can be done manually by visually inspecting the PCA projections for known irreducible multi-dimensional structures (e.g. circles, see Fig. 2) or automatically by passing the PCA projections to the tests for Definition 3"【9:0†source】.
        2. "As described in Section 4, given a cluster of dictionary elements S ⊂ {1, . . . ,m}, we run a large set of activations through the SAE, then filter out samples which don’t activate any element in S. For samples which do activate an element of S, reconstruct the activation while setting all SAE features not in S to have a hidden activation of zero. If some collection of SAE features together represent some irreducible feature, we want to remove all other features from the activation vector, and so we only allow SAE features in the collection to participate in reconstructing the input activation"【9:2†source】.
        
        These lines explain the process of clustering dictionary elements based on their similarities and then reconstructing activations to identify and label irreducible multi-dimensional features.

### Future work

- **IMPT:** Within-models: also use cca on activations for analogous domains. this shows the abstract structure has “analogous” mappings from one domain to another. Like months and numbers.
    - LEVEL 1: The category is a higher-order structure (circles, simplices, etc)
        - Higher-order structures can just be pair-wise (2-simplex) relation between features (with “analogous” roles). This can be distance, or causal. 3-simplex: “father-mother-daughter”
            - each object is a cluster of points, or the LDA vector est of the cluster
            - Each edge is a vector addition or difference?
        - A simplex approximates a manifold subspace. So categories are subspaces.
    - LEVEL 2: The functor is a mapping between higher-order structures WITHIN-MODEL
        - Not just any triangle. But the idea that “man-woman-child” can be encoded in BOTH “king-queen-princess” and “father-mother-daughter”. Both contain this “man-woman-child” basis, and CCA may map these CVs. This “man-woman-child” is the common abstraction, or functor mapping, between the two categories.
            - The functor IS the analogy
        - If month clusters are arranged circularly, how are numbers mapped with them?
            - each data pt isn’t a month, but a feature weight (not actv)
        - Do circuits compose the functor structure with more specific features?
            - Might require several transformations into a space that cleanly shows this
    - LEVEL 3: The “natural transformation” maps functors (of structures) between models.
        - This shows universality of analogies, and how models converge to them

    CCA finds lin combo of features with highest correlation 
    
    So in cca say features man woman child, and father mother daughter, or king queen princess, are most correlated? Analogous?
    
    In cca can you find which combos map to each other, say if man woman maps to king queen, by coefficients basis
    
    So from cca coefficients can we get mapping of features to features based on their relns

- explain the L0 norm col of the table in:
    
    The "L0 norm" column in the table refers to the number of non-zero coefficients in the sparse autoencoder (SAE) representations. In this context, a lower L0 norm indicates that fewer features are being used to represent the data, which aligns with the goal of sparsity. Sparse representations are desirable as they make the model more interpretable by emphasizing the most important features. The table shows the L0 norm for different layers, indicating how many features are active in each layer after training the SAEs.

        - eg) do they both arrange months circular? what other circulars found by algo?
            - can we map the circular structures?
    - toy model feature splitting: give cost estimates of llm and sae training
    - complexity of mapping algorithms

1. assumps + parameters for sim code for between saes
2. train saes on toy model
    1. get neuronpedia / eleuther to do this
    2. look for feature splitting
3. in another layer, track how a specific set of features (eg. love or cat) changes after steering
- funcsim: are two features across models also connected to analogous features in later layers?
- can you compare ground truth features as the intermediary? no- the "ground truth features" are model specific right, so it wouldn't make sense to see if two diff LLMs are learning the same ground truth feature
- train a model to map between features from two saes

Run code of “The Geometry of Categorical” on new data related to behavior

- email kiho on interpreting paper and checking if method to measure simplex based on orth relations is right
    - ask about comparing relations across models
    - ask if using TDA to identify simplex works
        - in a space of data point, how do I find which data points belong to an n-simplex, etc, using algorithms?
- brainstorm how to extend hierarchical concepts
    - steer by animal simplex
        - get convex hull that represents “animal” and add it?
            - how do you even add this?
            - estimate vector and convex hull using trained projection (LDA, linear map)- which to recommend?
- put face features thru existing code (geom, circ) on multiple models and look for hierachy (dog face and human face orthon) and other patterns
- find where hierarchy is detected in code nbs

    animal has cosine 1 with all others concepts bc they are all related to animal. but why 1, the max?

Steering circuits

- Probes to obtain “analogous steering vectors” across domains- apply these and observe the geometry
    - across models, find feature relation patterns that ‘explain’ analogous steering
    - the higher-order structures you find may be the  steerable “abstraction” common to a domain that you can extract and combine (eg. months with ordinal) from specific examples
    - or save for future paper

- [The fact that both features contribute to the final output indicates that the model has partially predicted a sentiment from John's statement (the second feature) but will do more downstream processing on the content of his statement (as represented by the first feature) as well.](https://www.notion.so/Scaling-Monosemanticity-Extracting-Interpretable-Features-from-Claude-3-Sonnet-3219b222ee8943ac9ba1a07963f975b0?pvs=21)
    - Can we better formalize these causal relations between features?
- 80Gb instead of 40Gb for A100- vast ai may specify this
- automatically find steering vectors using dataset samples

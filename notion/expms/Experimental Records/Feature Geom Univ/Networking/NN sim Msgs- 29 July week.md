Inquiry on Collab with University of Oxford Group on Sim Metrics+ Transformers 

Hi, I was very interested in your work on applying similarity metrics to neural networks! I am a research intern working in the Torr Vision Group at the University of Oxford from July to Sept, and as part of a paper I am writing, I have been applying similarity metrics to a relatively new field of transformer interpretability research. Specifically, I am conducting research in a field that has been using a technique to extract highly interpretable features from LLM neuron activations.

I have done preliminary experiments, and have a write-up of the overall project and main research questions. However, I have only started to use these similarity metrics, and would like to consult with experts in the field to: 1) Manifest new ideas we may have by exchanging ideas between NN similarity and AI interpretability, and to 2) Ensure these similarity metric experiments are done correctly.

I was wondering if you would be interested to meet and talk about a possible collaboration in the field? I can discuss the main research questions and experiments. Alternatively, if you know anyone else in the field (such as Masters/PhD students) who may be interested in talking, I would be happy to meet with them too. If you are not looking to collaborate, I am also looking to include experts in the field in the Acknowledgements. I am free any time next week or later, except at 1-2pm Mondays (CEST) and at 3-4pm Fridays (CEST). Thank you!

- why not just cosine sim?

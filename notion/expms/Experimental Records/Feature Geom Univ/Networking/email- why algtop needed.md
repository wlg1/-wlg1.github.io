# email- why algtop needed

Question about Mapper from papers

Hi, I saw that you had published work involving Mapper. I had some questions about the algorithm, as I am thinking about applying it and citing your work. Namely, I am wondering why concepts from algebraic topology are needed.

1) If we get a graph from clustering by finding overlapping clusters based on shared data points, we can construct a non-simplicial graph. What does this simple approach lack, compared to constructing a simplicial complex using mapper?

2) Why does the filter function depend on concepts from algebraic topology to work? Could it be used with just a graph made from clustering, and not a simplicial complex?

Thank you.

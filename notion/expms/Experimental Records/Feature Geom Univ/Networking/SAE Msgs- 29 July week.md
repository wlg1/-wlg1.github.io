Inquiry on Collab with University of Oxford Group on SAE feature geometry

Hi, I was fascinated by your work on SAEs! I am a research intern working in the Torr Vision Group at the University of Oxford from July to Sept, and as part of a paper I am writing, I have been studying the feature geometry of SAEs.

I have done preliminary experiments and have a write-up of the overall project and main research questions. However, I have only started to use TDA, and would like to consult with experts in the field to: 1) Exchange ideas and manifest new ones, and to 2) Ensure SAE methods are correctly applied.

I was wondering if you would interested to meet and talk about a possible collaboration in the field? I can discuss the main research questions and experiments. Alternatively, if you know anyone else in the field (including Masters/PhD students) who may be interested in talking, I would be happy to meet with them too. If you are not looking to collaborate, I am also looking to include experts in the field in the Acknowledgements. I am free any time next week or later, except at 12-1pm Mondays (BST) and at 2-3pm Fridays (BST). Thank you!

Overall project direction:

Hi, I started working on a paper that involves SAE training on tinystories models to compare feature splitting by feature geometries. I saw you have been doing SAE training, and as I’m still learning the practices for it, I was wondering if I can talk or meet with you about ways to tune SAE training to select more monosemantic and truer features in the dataset, such as a feature that is monosemantic for “king”? If so, I can share some of the work I’ve started with doing to see what direction to improve it in.

I am also interested in finding collaborators; if you are also interested, I can share the bigger picture of the research goals too.

Say this to sae ppl:

- Don’t tell SAE ppl about TDA unless they agree to collab. Just mention CCA, relation mapping, etc.
- Don't give details of but say developing method for func sim.

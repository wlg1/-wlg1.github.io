Inquiry on Collab with University of Oxford Group on TDA + Transformers 

Hi, I was fascinated by your work on applying TDA to neural networks! I am a research intern working in the Torr Vision Group at the University of Oxford from July to Sept, and as part of a paper I am writing, I have been applying TDA to a new field of transformer interpretability research.

Specifically, I am conducting research in a field that has been using a technique to extract highly interpretable features from LLM neuron activations, and I have been applying Mapper to this new feature space.

I have done preliminary experiments, and have a write-up of the overall project and main research questions. However, I have only started to use TDA, and would like to consult with experts in the field to: 1) Manifest new ideas we may have by exchanging ideas between TDA and AI interpretability, and to 2) Ensure TDA is correctly applied.

I was wondering if you would be interested to meet and talk about a possible collaboration in the field? I can discuss the main research questions and experiments. Alternatively, if you know anyone else in the field (including Masters/PhD students) who may be interested in talking, I would be happy to meet with them too. If you are not looking to collaborate, I am also looking to include experts in the field in the Acknowledgements. I am free any time next week or later, except at 12-1pm Mondays (BST) and at 2-3pm Fridays (BST). Thank you!

NOTE: change BST to their timezone (you est they’re in)

As mentioned before, one of the subtopics I'm looking at 

Overall, 

One of the preliminary experiments I ran is to highlight feature weights across 

Such as the token “once” or “upon”.

TIPS- Say this to algtop/geom ppl:

- Have been using a technqiue recently applied by researchers to extract features from LLM neuron activations, then apply in this new feature space
- Don’t mention func sim

# Feature Splitting Across Models

makelov; feature splitting oversplit. Is there a limit on what saes should be? so cant just use big enough saes?

higher-order struc: months in mistrial + llama 

- focus on feature splitting clustering. as more features split, do they still align? or do they split differently across differently models?
    
    Feature Splitting was studied for **one** model. There has not been working in studying how it varies **across models**
    
    Understanding how feature splitting works can improve how we use SAEs to find more detailed features, which allows for more specific steering and interpretability
    
- example: arabic food and language INPUTS have similar dist in feature space across models? when are they the same?
- see if the “structure” of diff features is similar in one to another
- cca of just those features
- is dsitances of feature splitting comparable across models

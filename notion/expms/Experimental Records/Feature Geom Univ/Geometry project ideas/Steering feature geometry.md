# Steering feature geometry

Geometric relations of features after steering or ablating

Composition across layers, geometric change

Two separate papers, but act as backups.  Explore downstream effects of steering feature vectors on ablated features and how those changes are in geometry and toplpgy. Will there still be a simplex? A cluster?

Vary sparsity and get diff feature cosines. Patch and what happens? Functionally equivalent across models in geometry?

Changing “I am unable to” is a gimmick. The main draw is finding how geometry and topology relation changes when features changed or fine tuned. Does it separate out better? Spline grokkjng training. Plot featrue ACTIVATIONS means there should be a change.

kmeans cluster to find inputs that activate the same features

Steer models with similar features from same or related cluster- what's the difference? Is there a correlation between feature similarity and output effect?

# Plan

circuits plan:

1. first find features for love-hate in gpt2
2. then find for safety vectors in larger models

First paper (ICLR) may just be about this technique in smaller models, such as love-hate or finding animal composability relations. (eg. this would still be a paper with impt findings, like how the IOI-SAE feature paper did this just for iOI). If have time, can extend to safety behaviors in larger models, but this may be for later paper

geom paper may be separate if only find relns for animal, but can combine with steering vecs circuits if find geom relns for love-hate

starting steering vecs (behavior interp circuits): love-hate (small), anger (xl)

first find this in smaller models as a proof of concept, then consult with more experts by showing proof-of-concept to extend this to larger models

"feature relations" aren't as intuitive to humans for language as they are for vision (eg. we identify a face via relations between noses, eyes, etc but it's not as intuitive to phrase this for language concepts, though the anthropic papers do mention feature relations in the umap plots)

Issue is hard to isolate commonality. What if more than one commonality? Even for vision models. For text, there's position. But sample at many pos, many contexts and they have commonality. If use synonymous tokens or of Same class.

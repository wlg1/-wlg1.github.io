# Multilayer features

are certain features only expressed in multiple layers?

look at MI server #sparse-coding (logan riggs) says did try multiple layers but disentanglement using MLP, so expresses features in a diff language, so have to get something invariant to this translation

2 layers, hypothesize MLP is destroying entanglement. can we stitch together two layers, extend sae architecture to include linear layer between or train a translator?

certain steering vectors are composed of multiple layers?

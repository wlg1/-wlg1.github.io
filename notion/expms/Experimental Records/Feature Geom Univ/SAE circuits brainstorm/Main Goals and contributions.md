# Main Goals and contributions

**Main topic**: Measure what groups of feature RELATIONS are affected by steering vectors (or other vector representations) across models to pinpoint that targetting them will improve steering vector by reducing noise

- Steer by feature relations?
- Sparse features can STILL have relations to one another in geometric space! AND we can decompose these vectors- bc theyâ€™re vectors.

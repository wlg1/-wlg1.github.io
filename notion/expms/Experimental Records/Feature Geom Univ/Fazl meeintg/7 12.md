phi models quantized binary

future meetings:
my plot vs anthropic's plot
arabic feature: category food subdivide then persian and arabic have basis, so concatenate other aspects of higher order to create
every word has base, so do the sae also discover this basis mono feature basis to create other words
structure of using roots is the same; world and contients (asia, africa,; countries; but when does it stop?)
words in arabic has a base
book word
semantically similara words have same base
michelle lo: in order to relearn the concept of 'canada', as long as any country in america is there, you relearn concept of canada

situational awareness: some tokens in english can no longer be split into subfeatures, but in arabic there may be
no base in english, almost every other word in arabic
if the saes are very large, the arabic do they split into bases and not any further?

adol knows arabic
RL: rho is about walking. so rho + x is something else about walking.

if 5 splits for same word in english, maybe extra split in arabic
even within models, languges might have similar splits.

train saes on models that can do language
saelens has pretrained feature splitting but only on gpt2
llama3

next week meeting: have feature splitting, verify if worth spending more time

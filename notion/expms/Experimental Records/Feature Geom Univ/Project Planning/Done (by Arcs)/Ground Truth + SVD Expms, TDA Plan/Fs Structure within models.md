# Fs Structure within models

Can we replace feature in larger group with smaller group features?

Measure sim of features in feature splitting with larger features. Which collection add up to it?

Ask vidit for advice on measuring this

Find adv example feature splits

Frature fams

Ask Joseph for feedback since he's doing hierarchical clustering on feat splits

Steerable features within feature splits

Measure this across models but thats not jmpt

Measure feature splits in synthetic data

Mix and match features split. Feature stitching. But can't do this if features are unique to sae.

Hierarchical clustering considers features from diff saes all in same dataset? Then finds if hierarchy of features 

What I am looking for is if there is a topological relarion among these features that makes up the original feature

Next, abstraction across similar features

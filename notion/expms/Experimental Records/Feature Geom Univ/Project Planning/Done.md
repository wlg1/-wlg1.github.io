**EXPM**: Observe how steering affects features downstream

- ✅ implement ‘see what steering at a layer affect other features’

    **TODO:** change these features and measure how the steering vector performs in output and on benchmarks (latter may be noted as next steps when presenting)
    
    - plan detailed steps
        1. Difference of 2 contrastive prompts actvs at layer k of GPT-2
            1. do contrastive sets later
        2. For third prompt, apply steering vector at layer k
        3. Cache activations from layer k to last layer L for unst & steered runs
        4. Pass both those activations through their respective pre-trained SAEs
        5. Observe differences, before and after steering, for features from layer k to last layer L
            1. Obtain features via SAE, SVD, etc.
        - Later work
            1. Interpret features using dataset example labeling, unembedding methods (eg. logit lens), patching (for causal relations)
                1. Eg) Does the anger vector alter features related to anger?
            2. Generalize universal patterns across models and different classes of steering vectors (eg. vectors representing parent-child relations)
                1. Eg) The anger vector always alters F1 and F2, where F1 = P*F2, F1 activates on “fearful” and F2 activates on “threat”
            3. Patch back in feature ablated in later layers
                - Put SAE reconstructions back into model

    This implementation simplifies away the wrappers that hide the fns to make it easier to understand the basics of the steering algorithms
    
    - ✅ STEP 1: get contrastive activations for 2 prompts of gpt-2

            - pass them both in batch, then take actvs of each batch index
    - ✅ STEP 2: For third prompt, apply steering vector at layer k
        - ✅ hook fn to add? look at prev repos how they did it

    - ✅⚠️STEP 3: Cache activations from layer k to last layer L for unst & steered runs
        - ⚠️ ISSUE: for multiple generated tokens, which activations do we store? it’s not just the “next” one. then we need to pass all of them thru SAEs. perhaps we can track ALL the activations of every pos? but it’s not really comparable.
            - ✅ for now, just work with the immediate next generation  (for next token)
    - ✅ STEP 4: Pass both those activations through their respective pre-trained SAEs
        
        NOTE: pretrained use SAELens (which is built on transformerlens), and cache uses transformerlens. Only need to combine saes with tl for step 4

        - ✅ find feature inds with highest values
        - ✅ for each feature, find its highest actv tokens on pretrained sae’s dataset
            - ✅ need to flatten (batch,seq) into batch*seq first because it's ANY batch_seq, even if in same batch or same pos
            - ✅ top_acts_indices should be also be 1D. Then convert the indices into (batch, seq)
            - ✅ broadcast steering vec to actv samps

                and steering_vec is [1, 128, 768), will pytorch broadcast steering_vec to every batch samp in first dim?
                
            - ✅ we’re finding top features AFTER steering? they’re not going to be found before steering since it’s not obvious they’d activate? so dataset examples should only activate after steering on batch_tokens
                
                
    - ✅ STEP 5: Differences, before and after steering, for features from layer k to last layer
        - pass their differences too
        - feature inds or batch_seq inds may not be right because sae flattens them but saelens doesn’t give them as batch_seq. double check if you’re computing the right ones
            
            [https://chatgpt.com/c/d7e78853-306c-4763-8798-684d48c7bcb4](https://chatgpt.com/c/d7e78853-306c-4763-8798-684d48c7bcb4)
            
- ✅ figure out why saelens only trained resid_pre, not resid_post. in pytorch huggingface transformers, is resid post 5 the same as resid pre 6?
    
    In the context of the Hugging Face Transformers library and the architecture of Transformer models (like GPT), "resid post 5" and "resid pre 6" refer to the residual connections at different stages of the transformer layers.
    
    1. **resid post 5**: This typically refers to the output after the 5th transformer layer, including its residual connection.
    2. **resid pre 6**: This typically refers to the input to the 6th transformer layer, before any operations (like self-attention or feed-forward) are applied in that layer.
    
    In the architecture of a Transformer model, the output of one layer (including its residual connection) is the input to the next layer. Hence, the output of the 5th layer (which includes the residual connection, i.e., "resid post 5") is indeed the input to the 6th layer (i.e., "resid pre 6").
    
    Therefore, **"resid post 5" is the same as "resid pre 6"**. They are different terms for the same data tensor within the model architecture, just viewed from the perspective of different layers.
    
- ✅ Why are dataset examples for 5_resid_post and 6_resid_pre different for the same features?
    - This code outputs 1, showing they’re the exact same thing
        
        ```jsx
        comparison_result = (unst_cache['blocks.6.hook_resid_pre'] == unst_cache['blocks.5.hook_resid_post'])
        num_true = torch.sum(comparison_result).item()
        total_elements = comparison_result.numel()
        num_true / total_elements
        ```
        
    - ✅ SOLN: they’re the same, but each time you run dataset examples, you get different results
        
        The code exhibits randomness due to the use of `activation_store.get_batch_tokens()`, which is likely fetching a random batch of tokens from a dataset each time it is called. This introduces variability in the examples displayed each run.
        
    - ✅ [https://jbloomaus.github.io/SAELens/api/#sae_lens.ActivationsStore](https://jbloomaus.github.io/SAELens/api/#sae_lens.ActivationsStore)
    - ✅ `get_batch_tokens` doesn’t take num samples as arg, prob bc outdated vers but only old vers works for code in nb
        - you can replace fn but this still misses args

        - Using 128, we find 5 post and 6 pre are the same. Also, later layers have closer features. Why doesn’t it change later layers if it changes output signif?
    - ✅ try samples from openwebtext that contain ‘love’ or ‘hate’ in them

    - NOTE: in dataset examples, when the activation of a (samp, feat) is 0 (so feature doesn’t activate on anything else), it will default to batch 0 and a seq in it, but that doesn’t mean anything

    - Hi, got a question from the blog post. It was stated:
        
        [https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/C5KAZQib3bzzpeyrg/full-post-progress-update-1-from-the-gdm-mech-interp-team](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/C5KAZQib3bzzpeyrg/full-post-progress-update-1-from-the-gdm-mech-interp-team)
        
        “look at the active features on the “ger” token of the “|BOS|An|ger|'' input.”
        
        Which dataset was used for this, and how many samples? For a certain steering vector in GPT2 small, I’m looking at the pretrained SAEs of SAELens and thinking about using the samples from activationstore (the activationstore of its pretrained sae gpt2 models uses Skylion007/openwebtext), though not sure if this is a good approach.

- just use neuronpedia to get max actv examples for top features
    
    I think I understand better now you find the top features and look up the top activating examples on neuronpedia; that's what the "Feature dashboard:" board is (I had used other code to get max actv examples)
    
    - you can also just directly search up features on neuronpedia
        - actually i could've just search up keywords using explanations on neuronpedia, i just found the same neuron on it that way

    Thanks for the links! I was wondering if you have any findings about how steering specific parts of "component roles" in a circuit might have a specific effect on the input? For instance, ablating/patching/steering at subject inhibitors might affect which subjects are inhibited. I saw Makelov's research does do name steering at specific components of the IOI circuit, but I think the paper's focus was more about studying supervised vs sae features. If you have done work similar to this I'm interested in generalizing this to other behaviors
    
- ✅ msg luke
    
    Thanks for mentioning issues about the side effect speculation today, I was wondering if you can write it down again in a msg so I can be more aware of what to address? I think it was said "the reason the steering vector may work at layer L and not earlier layers is because layer L and after would not have side effects, while earlier layers may". Or may be something else
    
    - Sorry, forgot to reply to your earlier message. The person working with Alex is called Jacob. I don't recall his last name but his initials are GW.
    - Your description of what I said earlier is pretty accurate, but my question was a bit more general, and was more like "why think there is a meaningful explanation for side effects at all?", and then an example I gave is that side effects may differ massively based on the activations of the layer(s) you modify
    
    Thanks for the reply! I didn't get to the second part of my project talk yet, but it has something to do with comparing saes across models. I think your project is about finding better sae features for a model using a method you call alignment regularization; it's not directly related to what I'm thinking of, but I think you have some useful insights into how saes can better learn true features. Given that you have experience comparing saes I think I may have several questions to ask later if you have time in a few weeks. I'm running prelim geom experiments now so it'd be easier to explain once I finish them

    There is no perpendicular direction (in 1D space) to adjust one point without affecting the others. In higher dimensions, if vectors are not collinear, you have the freedom to move perpendicularly to affect one variable without altering the relative positions of others. 
    
    - what's the probability of w2? is that a different point on the line?
        
        Let's break it down intuitively using the concept of collinear points and probabilities.
        
        When we talk about the vectors \(\bar{\ell}*{w_0}, \bar{\ell}*{w_1}, \bar{\ell}_{w_2}\) being on a line, we are essentially saying that the positions of these points can be described using a single dimension. In this case:
        
        1. **Probabilities along a Line**: If these vectors are collinear, any change in the probability of one attribute (e.g., \(w_2\)) will necessarily influence the relative probabilities of the other attributes (\(w_0\) and \(w_1\)) because all movements are constrained to the line they form.
        2. **Probability of \(w_2\)**: The probability of \(w_2\) can be seen as a point along the line formed by \(\bar{\ell}*{w_0}, \bar{\ell}*{w_1}, \bar{\ell}_{w_2}\). To change the probability of \(w_2\), you have to move along this line. This movement will also affect the relative probabilities of \(w_0\) and \(w_1\).
        3. **Impact of Collinearity**: Since there is no direction in the line that allows you to move independently to change the probability of \(w_2\) without also affecting \(w_0\) and \(w_1\), you can't adjust one without influencing the others.
        
        To visualize this, think of the line as a tightrope. If you are walking along the tightrope (the line), every step forward or backward changes your position relative to all points on the tightrope. There's no way to step to the side (no perpendicular movement), so every move affects your relative position to all other points on the line.
        
        In summary, the probability of \(w_2\) is represented by a point on this line. To change this probability (i.e., move this point), you must move along the line, inherently affecting the relative probabilities of \(w_0\) and \(w_1\) as well.

            - make sure you’re plotting by the cols? for decoder?
                
                Yes, it does matter whether you plot by columns or rows of the weight matrix because it changes the meaning of the points in the UMAP plot.
                
                ### Plotting Rows vs. Columns
                
                1. **Plotting Rows of the Weight Matrix:**
                    - Each row represents a different feature (in your case, 768 features).
                    - The UMAP plot will show the relationships between these features in a lower-dimensional space.
                    - This is useful if you want to understand how the features are related or clustered based on the autoencoder's weight matrix.
                2. **Plotting Columns of the Weight Matrix:**
                    - Each column represents a different input dimension (in your case, 24576 dimensions).
                    - The UMAP plot will show the relationships between the input dimensions in a lower-dimensional space.
                    - This is useful if you want to understand how the input dimensions are represented or clustered based on the autoencoder's weight matrix.
                
                ### Example: Plotting Rows
                
                If you want to visualize the relationships between the features, you should plot the rows of the weight matrix.
                
                ```python
                import umap
                import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
                
                # Assuming weight_matrix is your original matrix of size [768, 24576]
                
                # Initialize UMAP
                reducer = umap.UMAP(n_neighbors=15, min_dist=0.1, metric='euclidean')
                
                # Fit and transform the data by rows
                embedding = reducer.fit_transform(weight_matrix)
                
                # Plot the UMAP result
                plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
                plt.scatter(embedding[:, 0], embedding[:, 1], s=5, cmap='Spectral')
                plt.title('UMAP of Weight Matrix by Rows (Features)')
                plt.xlabel('UMAP Component 1')
                plt.ylabel('UMAP Component 2')
                plt.show()
                
                ```
                
                ### Example: Plotting Columns
                
                If you want to visualize the relationships between the input dimensions, you should transpose the weight matrix and plot the columns.
                
                ```python
                # Transpose the weight matrix to get dimensions [24576, 768]
                transposed_weight_matrix = weight_matrix.T
                
                # Initialize UMAP
                reducer = umap.UMAP(n_neighbors=15, min_dist=0.1, metric='euclidean')
                
                # Fit and transform the data by columns
                embedding = reducer.fit_transform(transposed_weight_matrix)
                
                # Plot the UMAP result
                plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
                plt.scatter(embedding[:, 0], embedding[:, 1], s=5, cmap='Spectral')
                plt.title('UMAP of Weight Matrix by Columns (Input Dimensions)')
                plt.xlabel('UMAP Component 1')
                plt.ylabel('UMAP Component 2')
                plt.show()
                
                ```
                
                ### Choosing Rows or Columns
                
                - **Choose Rows** if you are interested in the feature relationships.
                - **Choose Columns** if you are interested in the input dimension relationships.
                
                Based on your previous context, if you want to see how the features encoded by the sparse autoencoder cluster, you should plot the rows of the weight matrix. If your interest lies in understanding how the original input dimensions (activations of layer 8 of GPT-2 small) cluster, then you should plot the columns.

    To phrase it better, I was thinking about how your method would approximate the true features better in one LLM. For two LLMs that are initialized differently, the saes trained on each of them for a layer would likely not find many analogous features. But if you train better saes, say with your method using the aggregates of multiple saes, I was wondering how much they would "converge' to find universally similar features, esp when features splitting occurs as saes get bigger. Similar to the platonic rep hypothesis. Do you think they would converge?
    
- ✅ chatgpt on ‘hier geom’ causal inner product reasons
    
    [https://chatgpt.com/c/fbfde9a6-76fd-4c88-a2bd-267312a4d3df](https://chatgpt.com/c/fbfde9a6-76fd-4c88-a2bd-267312a4d3df)
    
    - Why do we need to use the causal inner product? Why couldn't the authors have just looked for simplex orthogonality relations directly in the embedding space (last token, last layer) or unembedding space separately?
        1. **Unification of Embedding and Unembedding Spaces**:
        The causal inner product allows for the unification of the context embedding space (Λ) and the token unembedding space (Γ) into a single representation space. This unification is essential because it ensures that concepts represented in these distinct spaces can be compared and analyzed under a common framework. The transformation using an invertible matrix \( A \) and a constant vector \( \gamma_0 \) aligns these spaces such that the Euclidean inner product in the transformed space respects the semantics of language【6:2†source】.
        2. **Simplicity and Structure**:
        The causal inner product allows for the representation of categorical and hierarchical concepts as simple geometric structures, such as simplices. This geometric representation is more interpretable and aligns with the hierarchical nature of semantic concepts. By ensuring orthogonality and maintaining a unified representation space, the causal inner product supports the formation of these geometric structures, facilitating easier manipulation and understanding of the concepts【6:12†source】【6:14†source】.
        3. **Empirical Validation**:
        The theoretical results are empirically validated using a large language model (Gemma-2B). The transformation to a canonical representation space via the causal inner product allows for the alignment of the embedding and unembedding representations, enabling the observation and measurement of the predicted geometric structures in practice. This empirical validation strengthens the theoretical foundation laid out by the authors【6:12†source】.
        
        Directly looking for simplex orthogonality relations in either the embedding space or the unembedding space separately would not ensure the alignment of these spaces or respect the hierarchical and causal relationships between concepts. The causal inner product provides a rigorous mathematical framework that ensures these properties are maintained, enabling a more accurate and interpretable representation of semantic structures in language models.
        
    - Was LDA used to get a vector in the causal inner product's space? If we just look at individual activation spaces of a layer, do we need LDA or can we just look at the activation vector directly?
        1. **Separate Classes**: The primary role of LDA is to find a projection that maximizes the separation between different classes (e.g., words belonging to different concepts) while minimizing the variance within each class. This helps in creating a clear distinction between concepts in the representation space.
        2. **Minimize Variance**: By minimizing the within-class variance, LDA ensures that the projection of the unembedding vectors for tokens associated with a specific concept (e.g., "mammal") is consistent, which aligns with the requirement that concepts should have well-defined vector representations with minimal variance around a central value.
        3. **Align with Theoretical Results**: The LDA-based estimation of vector representations aligns with the theoretical framework provided by the causal inner product, ensuring that the geometric properties such as orthogonality and simplex structures are preserved and observable in the empirical results.
        
        ### Looking at Individual Activation Spaces
        
        If we were to look at the activation vectors directly within an individual layer without transforming them via the causal inner product, there are some key considerations:
        
        1. **Representation Alignment**: Without the transformation provided by the causal inner product, the embeddings and unembeddings might not be aligned in a way that respects the semantic relationships between concepts. This misalignment can obscure the geometric structures (such as orthogonality and simplices) that are crucial for understanding the hierarchical relationships.
        2. **Need for LDA**: In the individual activation spaces, LDA can still be beneficial because it helps in finding directions that separate different classes of concepts. However, if the goal is to directly observe activation vectors, LDA might not be strictly necessary if the vectors already exhibit clear separations. Yet, typically, raw activation vectors might not be as well-separated without some form of dimensionality reduction or projection technique like LDA.
        3. **Empirical Consistency**: The empirical validation of theoretical results often requires transformations like LDA to ensure consistency with the theoretical framework. Direct observation of raw activation vectors might miss subtle relationships that are more apparent after applying LDA or similar techniques.
        
        ### 
        
    - actually LDA is used to get a vector for an attribute, which is a collection of tokens, using those tokens?
        
        Yes, you're correct. LDA (Linear Discriminant Analysis) is indeed used to get a vector representation for an attribute, which is essentially a collection of tokens. Here's a detailed explanation of how LDA is utilized in this context:
        
        ### Purpose of LDA in the Study
        
        LDA is employed to estimate the vector representations of attributes by utilizing the tokens associated with those attributes. Here's how this works:
        
        1. **Attribute and Token Relationship**: Each attribute (e.g., "mammal") is associated with a set of tokens (e.g., "dog," "cat," "elephant"). The goal is to find a vector that represents this attribute based on the embeddings of these tokens.
        2. **Class Separation**: LDA helps in finding a projection that maximizes the separation between the tokens associated with the attribute and those that are not. This ensures that the vector representation of the attribute captures the distinguishing features of the tokens that belong to it.
        3. **Minimizing Within-Class Variance**: LDA also minimizes the variance within the tokens of the same attribute. This means that the tokens associated with the attribute should have similar projections onto the resulting vector, making the representation consistent.
        
        ### Process of Using LDA
        
        Here's a step-by-step process of how LDA is used in this study:
        
        1. **Collect Tokens**: Gather the tokens that belong to the attribute (e.g., all tokens that can be considered "mammals").
        2. **Compute Unembedding Vectors**: For each token, compute its unembedding vector in the representation space.
        3. **Estimate the Vector Representation**: Use LDA to find the direction that best separates the tokens associated with the attribute from those that are not. This involves:
            - Calculating the mean vector for the tokens of the attribute.
            - Calculating the covariance matrix of these tokens.
            - Finding the direction that maximizes the between-class variance and minimizes the within-class variance.
        
        ### Equation for LDA-based Vector Estimation
        
        The LDA-based estimation of the vector representation for an attribute \( w \) is given by:
        \[ \ell_w = \frac{\text{Cov}(g_w)^{-1} \mathbb{E}(g_w)}{\|\text{Cov}(g_w)^{-1} \mathbb{E}(g_w)\|_2} \]
        where \( g_w \) represents the unembedding vectors of the tokens associated with the attribute \( w \), and \(\text{Cov}(g_w)\) is the covariance matrix of these vectors.
        
        ### Empirical Validation
        
        Using LDA in this manner ensures that the resulting vector representation of the attribute aligns with the theoretical expectations, such as the orthogonality of hierarchically related concepts and the simplex structure of categorical concepts. This process helps in empirically validating the theoretical results by showing that the estimated vectors exhibit the expected geometric properties.
        
        ### Conclusion
        
        LDA is indeed used to get a vector for an attribute by utilizing the tokens associated with that attribute. This approach ensures that the resulting vector representation accurately captures the distinguishing features of the attribute and aligns with the theoretical framework provided by the causal inner product.
        
    - i dont see here how multiple tokens aer used? it says g_w is just a word sampled
        
        The confusion arises from the notation and the explanation in the text. Let's clarify how multiple tokens are used to estimate the vector representation for an attribute using LDA:
        
        ### Explanation of the Equation
        
        1. **Tokens Associated with Attribute \( w \)**:
            - \( Y(w) \) represents the set of tokens associated with the attribute \( w \). For example, if \( w \) is "mammal," \( Y(w) \) might include tokens like "dog," "cat," "elephant," etc.
        2. **Unembedding Vectors**:
            - \( g_w \) represents the unembedding vector of a word sampled uniformly from \( Y(w) \). This means that for the calculation, each word in \( Y(w) \) has an unembedding vector \( g \), and \( g_w \) is the set of these vectors for all tokens in \( Y(w) \).
        3. **Covariance Matrix**:
            - The covariance matrix \( \text{Cov}(g_w) \) is computed using the unembedding vectors of all tokens in \( Y(w) \). This involves taking all the tokens associated with \( w \) and calculating the covariance of their unembedding vectors.
        4. **LDA Estimation**:
            - The vector \( \ell_w \) for the attribute \( w \) is estimated using these unembedding vectors. Specifically, the estimation involves calculating the mean vector \( \mathbb{E}(g_w) \) and the covariance matrix \( \text{Cov}(g_w) \) for the set of tokens.
        
        ### Detailed Steps
        
        1. **Collect Tokens**:
            - Gather all tokens that are associated with the attribute \( w \). This forms the set \( Y(w) \).
        2. **Compute Unembedding Vectors**:
            - For each token in \( Y(w) \), compute its unembedding vector. Let's denote the set of these vectors as \( \{ g_{w1}, g_{w2}, ..., g_{wn} \} \).
        3. **Calculate Covariance Matrix**:
            - Calculate the covariance matrix \( \text{Cov}(g_w) \) using the unembedding vectors of all tokens in \( Y(w) \). This matrix captures the variance and correlations of the vectors within the set.
        4. **Estimate Vector Representation**:
            - Use LDA to find a projection that separates the tokens associated with \( w \) from those not associated with it. The LDA process maximizes the separation between classes (tokens associated with \( w \) vs. those that are not) while minimizing the within-class variance.
        5. **Compute the Vector**:
            - The vector \( \ell_w \) is computed using the pseudo-inverse of the covariance matrix and the mean vector of the unembedding vectors. The formula provided in the text is:
            \[
            \ell_w = \left( \tilde{g}_w^T \mathbb{E}(g_w) \right) \tilde{g}_w, \quad \text{with} \quad \tilde{g}_w = \frac{\text{Cov}(g_w)^\dagger \mathbb{E}(g_w)}{\| \text{Cov}(g_w)^\dagger \mathbb{E}(g_w) \|_2}
            \]
            - Here, \( \mathbb{E}(g_w) \) is the mean of the unembedding vectors of tokens in \( Y(w) \), and \( \text{Cov}(g_w)^\dagger \) is the pseudo-inverse of the covariance matrix.
        
        ### Summary
        
        While the text may seem to suggest using a single token, it actually involves using the set of tokens associated with the attribute to compute the mean and covariance matrix. These are then used in the LDA process to estimate the attribute's vector representation. Thus, multiple tokens are indeed used to derive the vector \( \ell_w \) for the attribute \( w \).
        
    - why were these attribute vectors such as “L_bird” used, rather than individual tokens such as “bird”?
        
        The attribute vectors (e.g., \( \ell_{\text{bird}} \)) are used rather than individual token vectors (e.g., "bird") for several key reasons:
        
        ### 1. Capturing Generality and Abstraction
        
        - **Attribute vectors** represent the general concept or category that encompasses all tokens associated with that attribute. For example, the attribute vector \( \ell_{\text{bird}} \) captures the essence of the concept "bird" which includes all specific instances of birds (like "sparrow," "eagle," "parrot").
        - **Individual token vectors** represent specific words, which may only capture particular instances or narrower aspects of the attribute. The vector for "bird" might only reflect the specific usage of the word "bird" in the training data, rather than the entire category.
        
        ### 2. Reducing Variability and Noise
        
        - **Attribute vectors** are calculated by aggregating information from multiple tokens, reducing the variability and noise inherent in individual word usage. This aggregation results in a more robust and stable representation of the concept.
        - **Individual token vectors** can vary significantly depending on context and usage frequency, leading to less reliable representations if used in isolation.
        
        ### 3. Semantic Coherence
        
        - **Attribute vectors** ensure that the semantic properties of the entire category are captured. For instance, the vector \( \ell_{\text{bird}} \) is derived from multiple bird-related tokens, ensuring that the representation is semantically coherent and representative of the entire class.
        - **Individual token vectors** might not fully capture the hierarchical or categorical relationships within the data, missing out on the broader semantic context.
        
        ### 4. Facilitating Geometric Interpretations
        
        - **Attribute vectors** allow for the application of geometric interpretations such as orthogonality and simplex structures. These interpretations are crucial for understanding relationships between different concepts and categories in the representation space.
        - **Individual token vectors** do not provide a straightforward way to apply these geometric interpretations, as they are tied to specific instances rather than abstract categories.
        
        ### 5. Enabling Hierarchical and Categorical Analysis
        
        - **Attribute vectors** support the analysis of hierarchical and categorical relationships, which is essential for understanding the structure of semantic representations in language models. For example, \( \ell_{\text{mammal}} \) and \( \ell_{\text{animal}} \) can be used to study the hierarchical relationship between mammals and animals.
        - **Individual token vectors** do not easily facilitate this kind of analysis, as they do not inherently represent the broader categories or hierarchical levels.
        
        ### Practical Implementation
        
        As detailed in the provided document, the authors used LDA to derive these attribute vectors from the unembedding vectors of multiple tokens associated with each attribute. This method ensures that the resulting vectors are representative of the entire category rather than just individual instances.
        
        ### Conclusion
        
        Using attribute vectors such as \( \ell_{\text{bird}} \) instead of individual tokens like "bird" allows for more general, stable, and semantically coherent representations. These vectors facilitate the analysis of hierarchical and categorical structures in the representation space of language models, which is essential for understanding and interpreting the underlying semantic relationships.
        
    
    It seems like the statement “"the simplex of fish,mammal, bird is orthogonal to the vector representation of animal" is interpreted as span{¯ℓmammal,¯ℓbird,¯ℓfish} is orthogonal to L_animal. If so,  what does it mean that a * mammal + b*bird + c*fish is orthogonal to L_animal?
    
    - Semantically what does a * mammal + b*bird + c*fish mean? How can a specific vector be a combination of those?
        
        **Example**: Interpolating between "mammal" and "bird" might create a vector that captures semantic similarities or shared characteristics, such as being warm-blooded.
        
    - do the vectors in span{¯ℓmammal,¯ℓbird,¯ℓfish} represent specific animals?
        
        The vectors in \(\text{span}\{\ell_{\text{mammal}}, \ell_{\text{bird}}, \ell_{\text{fish}}\}\) do not necessarily represent specific animals directly. Instead, they represent combinations of the attributes associated with mammals, birds, and fish. Here’s a more detailed explanation:
        
        ### Understanding the Span
        
        1. **Span of Vectors**:
            - The span of \(\{\ell_{\text{mammal}}, \ell_{\text{bird}}, \ell_{\text{fish}}\}\) consists of all possible linear combinations of these vectors. Mathematically, this means any vector \( v \) in this span can be expressed as:
            \[
            v = a \cdot \ell_{\text{mammal}} + b \cdot \ell_{\text{bird}} + c \cdot \ell_{\text{fish}}
            \]
            - Here, \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are scalar coefficients.
        
        ### Semantic Interpretation
        
        1. **Attribute Combinations**:
            - The vectors within this span represent different mixtures or combinations of the semantic attributes associated with mammals, birds, and fish. They do not correspond to specific animals but rather to abstract concepts that blend these attributes.
        2. **Conceptual Space**:
            - For example, a vector in this span might represent a general concept that has some mammalian traits, some avian traits, and some piscine traits. This is more about capturing the shared and overlapping characteristics rather than pinpointing specific animals.
        3. **Abstract Entities**:
            - Such combinations could be used to model abstract or hypothetical entities. For instance, in a hypothetical or fantasy context, a vector in this span could represent a creature with a mix of traits from mammals, birds, and fish.
        
        ### Specific Animals and Attribute Vectors
        
        1. **Representing Specific Animals**:
            - Specific animals like "dog," "sparrow," or "salmon" would typically be represented by their own unique vectors, derived from their particular contexts and usage in the training data.
            - These specific animal vectors would be located in the broader semantic space, which might be influenced by the attribute vectors \(\ell_{\text{mammal}}, \ell_{\text{bird}}, \ell_{\text{fish}}\), but not confined to their span.
        2. **Hierarchical and Categorical Representation**:
            - The span of these attribute vectors provides a subspace that helps in understanding and organizing the broader semantic space. It’s useful for analyzing relationships and hierarchies but doesn’t directly map to specific instances.
        
        ### Practical Example
        
        - **Combining Attributes**: If you have \(\ell_{\text{mammal}}\), \(\ell_{\text{bird}}\), and \(\ell_{\text{fish}}\), a vector \(0.5 \cdot \ell_{\text{mammal}} + 0.3 \cdot \ell_{\text{bird}} + 0.2 \cdot \ell_{\text{fish}}\) might represent an abstract concept that combines features of these three classes. This vector is not a direct representation of a specific animal but rather an abstract blend.
        
        ### Conclusion
        
        The vectors in \(\text{span}\{\ell_{\text{mammal}}, \ell_{\text{bird}}, \ell_{\text{fish}}\}\) represent abstract combinations of the attributes associated with mammals, birds, and fish. They do not correspond directly to specific animals but provide a useful subspace for exploring the relationships and characteristics of these broader categories. Specific animals are represented by their own unique vectors within the broader semantic space of the model.
        
- ✅ How does whitening matrix "make" variables uncorrelated? Shouldn't the correlation be how the variables truly are? Or is it transforming the data into a perspective such that when look at it from that basis, the data is uncorrelated on that basis?
    
    [https://chatgpt.com/c/3091fef0-4b87-41f9-8df3-c4c4ef37db3f](https://chatgpt.com/c/3091fef0-4b87-41f9-8df3-c4c4ef37db3f)
    
    The concept of whitening a matrix is indeed to transform the data into a new basis where the variables are uncorrelated and standardized. This transformation doesn't change the true relationships between the variables but provides a different perspective or basis where the correlations between the transformed variables are zero, and their variances are equal to one. Here’s how it works and why it’s useful:
    
    ### How Whitening Works
    
    1. **Centering the Data**: The first step is to center the data by subtracting the mean of each variable, making the dataset have a mean of zero for each variable.
    2. **Covariance Matrix**: Compute the covariance matrix \( \Sigma \) of the centered data. This matrix contains the variances along the diagonal and the covariances off-diagonal, representing the relationships between the original variables.
    3. **Eigenvalue Decomposition**: Perform eigenvalue decomposition on the covariance matrix:
    \[
    \Sigma = V \Lambda V^T
    \]
    where \( V \) is a matrix of eigenvectors, and \( \Lambda \) is a diagonal matrix of eigenvalues.
    4. **Whitening Transformation**: The whitening matrix \( W \) is constructed using the eigenvectors and the inverse square root of the eigenvalues:
    \[
    W = \Lambda^{-\frac{1}{2}} V^T
    \]
    The whitened data \( X_{\text{whitened}} \) is obtained by multiplying the centered data \( X \) by the whitening matrix:
    \[
    X_{\text{whitened}} = X W
    \]
    
    ### Why Whitening Makes Variables Uncorrelated
    
    The multiplication by the whitening matrix \( W \) transforms the original data into a new space where:
    
    - **Uncorrelated Variables**: The covariance matrix of \( X_{\text{whitened}} \) becomes the identity matrix \( I \), meaning the variables are uncorrelated. This is because the whitening transformation diagonalizes the covariance matrix and rescales the eigenvalues to one.
    - **Unit Variance**: Each variable in the whitened data has a variance of one.
    
    ### Interpretation and Utility
    
    - **Perspective Transformation**: Whitening provides a new basis in which the data is analyzed. It doesn't alter the inherent relationships in the data but represents it in a way that is often more useful for certain algorithms and analyses (e.g., principal component analysis, independent component analysis).
    - **Standardization**: Whitening standardizes the data, which can be particularly beneficial for machine learning algorithms that are sensitive to the scale and correlation of the data (e.g., gradient-based optimization algorithms).
    
    ### Summary
    
    Whitening transforms the data such that, in the new basis, the variables are uncorrelated and have unit variance. This transformation is a mathematical tool to facilitate certain analyses and algorithms, not a reflection of the "true" state of the variables in their original form. The true correlations remain in the original data, but in the transformed space, the data is easier to work with for various applications.
    
- ✅ email kiho on project idea
    
    Hi, I was wondering if you have some advice on adjusting this project plan:
    
    I was thinking about how to detect simplex structures in intermediate layers. A starting point would be to just look at the embedded activation vectors of individual tokens, and to use LDA to calculate vectors for the attribution sets they belong to. Then we can calculate the orthogonality relations of these attribute vectors. I have a few questions about how to extend the “Hierarchical concepts” paper to intermediate layers:
    
    1) The paper looks for the structure in a canonical representation space with the causal inner product, not just in the embedding space. Would we have to “unify” an intermediate layer embedding with the unembedding space, if this is possible right now? Or would it make sense to look for orthogonality relations of attribute vectors constructed directly by LDA from activation vectors of individual tokens?
    
    2) In Figure 5, my understanding is the adjacency matrix doesn’t depend on the vectors, but is already there from Wordnet, and we want to check if it appears in the cosine sim matrix (fig 5b) but not for child-parent (fig 5c). Can we do this for intemediate space experiments? Also, would fig 5c show there’s a “nested” hierarchy where (animal - mammal) may be manipulated separately from (mammal-elephant)?
    
    3) Experimentally, should we show this for polytopes of say span{4 members or more} and not just span{3 members}?
    
    (The question below is less important for planning, so not needed to answer now):
    
    A) Why were these attribute vectors such as “L_bird” used, rather than individual tokens such as “bird”? I’m guessing we’re not trying to study individual tokens, but a general “subspace” of an attribute; a set of tokens in an attribute set form a “cluster” and we want to obtain the vector that represents that cluster over other clusters (so LDA maximizes between-class variance). Then L_bird estimates this “subspace” better. But what’s a good response if someone questions why we don’t just use “bird”?
    
    B) It seems like the statement "the simplex of fish,mammal, bird is orthogonal to the vector representation of animal" is interpreted as span{¯ℓmammal,¯ℓbird,¯ℓfish} is orthogonal to L_animal. If (a * mammal - b*bird + c*fish) is a member of the span, what does that mean semantically (I think we pass in an input that contains “traits” of all three?) and does it mean that semantically speaking, those specific traits are orthogonal to L_animal?

            - get CCA scores, but it’s slow
                
                Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) can indeed be computationally intensive, especially for large datasets or high-dimensional feature spaces. If you’re finding CCA to be very slow, there are several approaches and alternative methods you can consider to make the comparison more efficient and effective.
                
                Here’s a comprehensive guide to faster and more efficient ways to compare UMAP embeddings, including methods to speed up CCA and other alternatives:
                
                ### 1. **Optimizing CCA Performance**
                
                If you still want to use CCA, here are some strategies to optimize its performance:
                
                ### **a. Reduce Dimensionality Before CCA**
                
                Reducing the dimensionality of your feature space before applying CCA can significantly speed up the computation. You can use PCA (Principal Component Analysis) or any other dimensionality reduction technique for this purpose.
                
                ```python
                from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
                from sklearn.cross_decomposition import CCA
                
                # Reduce dimensionality with PCA before CCA
                pca1 = PCA(n_components=50)  # Adjust the number of components as needed
                pca2 = PCA(n_components=50)
                data1_reduced = pca1.fit_transform(embedding1)
                data2_reduced = pca2.fit_transform(embedding2)
                
                # Apply CCA
                cca = CCA(n_components=10)
                cca.fit(data1_reduced, data2_reduced)
                
                # Transform the data
                data1_c, data2_c = cca.transform(data1_reduced, data2_reduced)
                
                ```
                
                ### **b. Use Approximate CCA Algorithms**
                
                Consider using libraries or implementations optimized for large datasets. For instance, you can use the `sklearn` implementation of CCA, but there are also other libraries and frameworks designed for efficiency in large-scale computations.
                
                ### 2. **Alternative Methods for Comparing UMAP Embeddings**
                
                Here are several alternative methods for comparing UMAP embeddings that are generally faster and may provide useful insights:
                
                ### *a. **Procrustes Analysis**
                
                Procrustes analysis is a method for comparing the shapes of two datasets and can be done quickly with the `scipy` library.
                
                ```python
                from scipy.spatial import procrustes
                
                # Perform Procrustes analysis
                mtx1, mtx2, disparity = procrustes(embedding1, embedding2)
                
                print(f"Procrustes Disparity: {disparity}")
                
                ```
                
                ### *b. **k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) Consistency**
                
                Comparing the k-NN consistency measures how well the neighborhood structure is preserved across the two datasets.
                
                ```python
                from sklearn.neighbors import NearestNeighbors
                
                def knn_consistency(embedding1, embedding2, n_neighbors=5):
                    nbrs1 = NearestNeighbors(n_neighbors=n_neighbors).fit(embedding1)
                    nbrs2 = NearestNeighbors(n_neighbors=n_neighbors).fit(embedding2)
                    indices1 = nbrs1.kneighbors(return_distance=False)
                    indices2 = nbrs2.kneighbors(return_distance=False)
                    consistency = np.mean([len(np.intersect1d(indices1[i], indices2[i])) / n_neighbors for i in range(len(embedding1))])
                    return consistency
                
                knn_consistency_score = knn_consistency(embedding1, embedding2)
                print(f"k-NN Consistency: {knn_consistency_score}")
                
                ```
                
                ### *c. **Distance Correlation**
                
                Distance correlation measures both linear and non-linear relationships and is generally computationally efficient.
                
                ```python
                from scipy.spatial.distance import pdist, squareform
                from scipy.stats import pearsonr
                
                def distance_correlation(X, Y):
                    X_dist = squareform(pdist(X, 'euclidean'))
                    Y_dist = squareform(pdist(Y, 'euclidean'))
                    corr, _ = pearsonr(X_dist.ravel(), Y_dist.ravel())
                    return corr
                
                dist_corr = distance_correlation(embedding1, embedding2)
                print(f"Distance Correlation: {dist_corr}")
                
                ```
                
                ### *d. **Mutual Nearest Neighbors (MNN) Analysis**
                
                Mutual nearest neighbors can also be used to compare embeddings, though it may be less common.
                
                ```python
                from sklearn.neighbors import NearestNeighbors
                
                def mutual_nearest_neighbors(embedding1, embedding2, n_neighbors=5):
                    nbrs1 = NearestNeighbors(n_neighbors=n_neighbors).fit(embedding1)
                    nbrs2 = NearestNeighbors(n_neighbors=n_neighbors).fit(embedding2)
                    indices1 = nbrs1.kneighbors(return_distance=False)
                    indices2 = nbrs2.kneighbors(return_distance=False)
                    mnn_count = 0
                    for i in range(len(embedding1)):
                        mnn_count += len(set(indices1[i]).intersection(indices2[i]))
                    mnn_ratio = mnn_count / len(embedding1)
                    return mnn_ratio
                
                mnn_score = mutual_nearest_neighbors(embedding1, embedding2)
                print(f"Mutual Nearest Neighbors Ratio: {mnn_score}")
                
                ```
                
                ### 3. **Visualization for Initial Comparison**
                
                Sometimes, visual inspection of the UMAP embeddings can provide useful insights, and it is a quick first step:
                
                ```python
                import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
                
                # Plot the UMAP results
                fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(12, 6))
                axes[0].scatter(embedding1[:, 0], embedding1[:, 1], c='blue', label='Dataset 1')
                axes[0].set_title('UMAP Projection of Dataset 1')
                axes[0].legend()
                
                axes[1].scatter(embedding2[:, 0], embedding2[:, 1], c='green', label='Dataset 2')
                axes[1].set_title('UMAP Projection of Dataset 2')
                axes[1].legend()
                
                plt.show()
                
                ```
                
                ### 4. **Using UMAP’s `transform` for Different Seeds**
                
                To ensure consistent results across different seeds, you can set a fixed seed value for reproducibility in UMAP, but it's important to note that it does not eliminate the inherent randomness completely.
                
                ```python
                import umap
                
                # UMAP with a fixed seed for reproducibility
                reducer = umap.UMAP(random_state=42)
                embedding1 = reducer.fit_transform(data1)
                embedding2 = reducer.fit_transform(data2)
                
                ```
                
                ### 5. **Comparing UMAP Embeddings with Other Dimensionality Reduction Techniques**
                
                You might also want to compare UMAP embeddings using other dimensionality reduction techniques like t-SNE or PCA.
                
                ```python
                from sklearn.manifold import TSNE
                from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
                
                # t-SNE
                tsne = TSNE(n_components=2, random_state=42)
                embedding1_tsne = tsne.fit_transform(data1)
                embedding2_tsne = tsne.fit_transform(data2)
                
                # PCA
                pca = PCA(n_components=2)
                embedding1_pca = pca.fit_transform(data1)
                embedding2_pca = pca.fit_transform(data2)
                
                ```
                
                ### Summary Table of Methods and Performance
                
                | Method | Pros | Cons | Speed |
                | --- | --- | --- | --- |
                | CCA | Detailed canonical correlation analysis | Computationally intensive for large datasets | Slow |
                | PCA + CCA | Reduces dimensionality before CCA | Requires setting PCA components properly | Moderate |
                | Procrustes Analysis | Fast, effective for shape comparison | Measures only shape similarity | Fast |
                | k-NN Consistency | Simple, measures neighborhood structure | May not capture all relationships | Fast |
                | Distance Correlation | Captures both linear and non-linear relationships | Measures overall similarity | Fast |
                | Mutual Nearest Neighbors | Measures neighborhood consistency | Less common, may be less intuitive | Fast |
                | Visualization | Provides intuitive visual insights | Not a quantitative measure | Fast |
                | Other Dimensionality Reduction (t-SNE, PCA) | Useful for comparison, can be faster | t-SNE can be slow for large datasets | Moderate |
                
                ### Conclusion
                
                While CCA can be slow, there are several alternative methods for comparing UMAP embeddings that are computationally more efficient. By reducing dimensionality, using alternative comparison methods, or employing effective visualization techniques, you can achieve meaningful comparisons without extensive computation times.
                
                You can choose the approach based on the size of your dataset, the specific aspects you are interested in comparing, and the computational resources available to you.
                
                ### Example Code with Optimizations and Alternatives
                
                Here’s a comprehensive example incorporating PCA for dimensionality reduction, along with Procrustes Analysis, Distance Correlation, and k-NN Consistency:
                
                ```python
                import numpy as np
                import umap
                import cupy as cp
                from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
                from sklearn.neighbors import NearestNeighbors
                from scipy.spatial import procrustes
                from scipy.spatial.distance import pdist, squareform
                from scipy.stats import pearsonr
                from sklearn.datasets import make_blobs
                from time import time
                import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
                
                # Generate or load data
                data1 = np.random.rand(10000, 50)  # Synthetic data
                data2 = np.random.rand(10000, 50)  # Another synthetic dataset
                
                # Apply UMAP with a fixed random state
                reducer = umap.UMAP(random_state=42)
                embedding1 = reducer.fit_transform(data1)
                embedding2 = reducer.fit_transform(data2)
                
                # Reduce dimensionality with PCA before CCA
                pca1 = PCA(n_components=50)
                pca2 = PCA(n_components=50)
                data1_reduced = pca1.fit_transform(embedding1)
                data2_reduced = pca2.fit_transform(embedding2)
                
                # Apply CCA
                cca = CCA(n_components=
                ```
                
            - can i use cca on umap?
                
                Yes, you can use Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) on UMAP embeddings to compare the embeddings of two different datasets. The idea is to first reduce the dimensionality of both datasets using UMAP, and then use CCA to find the linear combinations of the UMAP embeddings that are maximally correlated.
                
                ### Step-by-Step Guide
                
                Here is a step-by-step guide to apply CCA on UMAP embeddings:
                
                1. **Install the Required Libraries**:
                Ensure you have `umap-learn`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, and `matplotlib` installed.
                    
                    ```python
                    !pip install umap-learn numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
                    
                    ```
                    
                2. **Import Libraries**:
                Import the necessary libraries for UMAP, CCA, and data manipulation.
                    
                    ```python
                    import numpy as np
                    import umap
                    from sklearn.cross_decomposition import CCA
                    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
                    
                    ```
                    
                3. **Generate or Load Data**:
                For demonstration purposes, let's create some synthetic data.
                    
                    ```python
                    # Generate synthetic data for demonstration
                    data1 = np.random.rand(100, 50)  # 100 samples with 50 features
                    data2 = np.random.rand(100, 50)  # Another dataset with the same dimensions
                    
                    ```
                    
                4. **Apply UMAP**:
                Use UMAP to reduce the dimensionality of both datasets.
                    
                    ```python
                    # Apply UMAP to both datasets
                    reducer = umap.UMAP(n_components=10, random_state=42)
                    embedding1 = reducer.fit_transform(data1)
                    embedding2 = reducer.fit_transform(data2)
                    
                    ```
                    
                5. **Apply CCA**:
                Use CCA to find the linear combinations of the UMAP embeddings that are maximally correlated.
                    
                    ```python
                    # Apply CCA on UMAP embeddings
                    cca = CCA(n_components=2)  # Number of components to extract
                    cca.fit(embedding1, embedding2)
                    
                    # Transform the data using CCA
                    cca_embedding1, cca_embedding2 = cca.transform(embedding1, embedding2)
                    
                    # Optional: To see the correlation coefficients
                    corrs = [np.corrcoef(cca_embedding1[:, i], cca_embedding2[:, i])[0, 1] for i in range(cca_embedding1.shape[1])]
                    print("Canonical Correlation Coefficients:", corrs)
                    
                    ```
                    
                6. **Visualize the Results**:
                Plot the first two canonical variables to visually inspect the correlation.
                    
                    ```python
                    # Plot the first two canonical variables
                    plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
                    
                    plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
                    plt.scatter(cca_embedding1[:, 0], cca_embedding1[:, 1], c='blue', label='UMAP Dataset 1')
                    plt.title('Canonical Variables of UMAP Dataset 1')
                    plt.xlabel('Canonical Variable 1')
                    plt.ylabel('Canonical Variable 2')
                    plt.legend()
                    
                    plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)
                    plt.scatter(cca_embedding2[:, 0], cca_embedding2[:, 1], c='green', label='UMAP Dataset 2')
                    plt.title('Canonical Variables of UMAP Dataset 2')
                    plt.xlabel('Canonical Variable 1')
                    plt.ylabel('Canonical Variable 2')
                    plt.legend()
                    
                    plt.show()
                    
                    ```
                    
                
                ### Complete Example Code
                
                Here's the complete code for applying CCA on UMAP embeddings and visualizing the results:
                
                ```python
                # Install the required libraries
                !pip install umap-learn numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
                
                # Import libraries

                import umap
                from sklearn.cross_decomposition import CCA
                import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
                
                # Generate synthetic data for demonstration
                data1 = np.random.rand(100, 50)  # 100 samples with 50 features
                data2 = np.random.rand(100, 50)  # Another dataset with the same dimensions
                
                # Apply UMAP to both datasets

                ### Explanation
                
                1. **UMAP**: Reduces the dimensionality of the datasets to a more manageable number of components (10 in this case).
                2. **CCA**: Finds the linear combinations of the UMAP embeddings that are maximally correlated.
                3. **Visualization**: Plots the first two canonical variables for both datasets to inspect the correlation visually.
                
                By following this approach, you can effectively use CCA on UMAP embeddings to compare the relationships between two datasets.
                
            - how to itnerpret this: Canonical Correlations: -0.23755626716455025
                
                Interpreting the results from Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) involves understanding both the canonical correlations and the correlation coefficients:
                
                ### Canonical Correlations
                
                The canonical correlations indicate the overall relationship between the sets of canonical variables. These values represent the strength of the linear relationships between the two sets of UMAP embeddings.
                
                - **Canonical Correlations**: These are the correlations between the first pair of canonical variables, the second pair, and so on. In your case, the canonical correlation values were found to be:
                    - 0.23755626716455025
                
                The negative value here might indicate an inverse relationship for the first canonical variable pair. Canonical correlations close to 1 or -1 indicate strong linear relationships, while those close to 0 indicate weak relationships.
                
                ### Correlation Coefficients
                
                The correlation coefficients between the transformed UMAP embeddings (canonical variables) represent how well the corresponding pairs of canonical variables correlate with each other.
                
                - **Correlation Coefficients**: These values show the correlation between the pairs of canonical variables. In your case, the coefficients are:
                    - [0.49006658992455354, 0.26686220794459087]
                
                Here's what these coefficients mean:
                
                1. **First Canonical Variable Pair**:
                    - Correlation Coefficient: 0.49006658992455354
                    - This indicates a moderate positive linear relationship between the first pair of canonical variables derived from the UMAP embeddings of the two datasets.
                2. **Second Canonical Variable Pair**:
                    - Correlation Coefficient: 0.26686220794459087
                    - This indicates a weaker positive linear relationship between the second pair of canonical variables.
                
                ### Interpretation Summary
                
                - The first canonical correlation is negative, suggesting an inverse relationship for the first pair of canonical variables.
                - The correlation coefficient for the first canonical variable pair is around 0.49, indicating a moderate positive relationship. This suggests that the first pair of canonical variables derived from the UMAP embeddings have a moderate positive linear association.
                - The correlation coefficient for the second canonical variable pair is around 0.27, indicating a weak positive relationship.
                
                These results suggest that while there is some degree of linear association between the canonical variables derived from the UMAP embeddings of your datasets, the relationships are not very strong. This implies that the structures captured by the UMAP embeddings of the two datasets have moderate to weak linear relationships when examined through the lens of CCA.
                
                ### Improving Interpretability
                
                To further interpret and validate these results, you might consider:
                
                1. **Visual Inspection**:
                    - Plot the pairs of canonical variables to visually inspect their relationships. This can help you understand the nature of the relationships better.
                    
                    ```python
                    plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
                    
                    plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
                    plt.scatter(cca_embedding1[:, 0], cca_embedding2[:, 0], c='blue', label='First Canonical Variable Pair')
                    plt.title('First Canonical Variable Pair')
                    plt.xlabel('First Canonical Variable (Dataset 1)')
                    plt.ylabel('First Canonical Variable (Dataset 2)')
                    plt.legend()
                    
                    plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)
                    plt.scatter(cca_embedding1[:, 1], cca_embedding2[:, 1], c='green', label='Second Canonical Variable Pair')
                    plt.title('Second Canonical Variable Pair')
                    plt.xlabel('Second Canonical Variable (Dataset 1)')
                    plt.ylabel('Second Canonical Variable (Dataset 2)')
                    plt.legend()
                    
                    plt.show()
                    
                    ```
                    
                2. **Dimensionality Reduction Before CCA**:
                    - If the datasets are very high-dimensional, consider using PCA to reduce the dimensionality before applying UMAP and CCA. This can sometimes enhance the interpretability of the canonical variables.
                3. **Investigating Other Relationships**:
                    - If the linear relationships are weak, you might consider investigating non-linear relationships using other methods such as kernel CCA or distance correlation.
                
                By examining these additional aspects, you can gain deeper insights into the relationships between your datasets as captured by UMAP and analyzed by CCA.

    Hi, I'm looking to run experiments similar to this section:
    
    [https://transformer-circuits.pub/2023/monosemantic-features#phenomenology-universality](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2023/monosemantic-features#phenomenology-universality)
    
    which involves comparing "different dictionary learning runs trained on different activations from a different transformer with different random seeds but otherwise identical hyperparameters." I was wondering if anyone has also done anything similar to this before (say a blog post / repo) and if they found any additional insights not mentioned by the Towards Monosemanticity paper? Would add to my lit review too

    Hi, as a quick summary of last week, I was running experiments and researching for a new project topic I can discuss with you next meeting. After some discussions with the other interns and lab members such as Ashkan, I decided this new project was more novel and impactful. The topic is about improving the understanding of SAE feature universality via geometric metrics such as canonical correlation analysis. Essentially, it is an extension of this Anthropic work: [https://transformer-circuits.pub/2023/monosemantic-features#phenomenology-universality](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2023/monosemantic-features#phenomenology-universality)
    
    My approach, which has not been tried yet on SAE feature space, uses geometric measurement techniques similar to (Kornblith et al, 2019),  “Similarity of Neural Network Representations Revisited” (of which Geoffrey Hinton is a coauthor). My project’s aim is also similar to that paper.
    
    I talked with other interns who offered good advice for the next experimental steps. I also presented the project to Ashkan, who gave a lot of other good advice in our meeting and found the proposed approach to be viable and interesting.

        - ✅ how come get nans in corrcoeff
            
            If you're getting NaN values in the correlation coefficient calculation, it's usually due to one of these reasons:
            
            1. Constant values: If all values in one or both of the tensors are the same (i.e., the tensor has zero variance), the correlation coefficient will be undefined (NaN).
            2. Presence of NaN or infinity values: If your tensors contain NaN or infinity values, these will propagate through the correlation calculation.
            3. All zero values: If one or both tensors contain all zeros, this can also lead to NaN in the correlation calculation.
            
            To diagnose and fix this issue, you can try the following:
            
            1. Check for constant values:
            
            ```python
            print("A constant?:", torch.all(tensor_A == tensor_A[0]))
            print("B constant?:", torch.all(tensor_B == tensor_B[0]))
            
            ```
            
            1. Check for NaN or infinity values:
            
            ```python
            print("A has NaN:", torch.isnan(tensor_A).any())
            print("B has NaN:", torch.isnan(tensor_B).any())
            print("A has inf:", torch.isinf(tensor_A).any())
            print("B has inf:", torch.isinf(tensor_B).any())
            
            ```
            
            1. Check for all zero values:
            
            ```python
            print("A all zeros?:", torch.all(tensor_A == 0))
            print("B all zeros?:", torch.all(tensor_B == 0))
            
            ```
            
            1. If you're still getting NaNs, you can try to calculate the correlation manually:
            
            ```python
            def manual_correlation(x, y):
                x_mean = x.mean()
                y_mean = y.mean()
                x_std = x.std()
                y_std = y.std()
            
                if x_std == 0 or y_std == 0:
                    return 0  # or you might want to return NaN here
            
                return ((x - x_mean) * (y - y_mean)).mean() / (x_std * y_std)
            
            corr = manual_correlation(tensor_A, tensor_B)
            print("Manual correlation:", corr)
            
            ```
            
            1. If you're dealing with very small numbers, numerical precision issues could arise. In this case, you might want to scale your data:
            
            ```python
            tensor_A_scaled = (tensor_A - tensor_A.mean()) / tensor_A.std()
            tensor_B_scaled = (tensor_B - tensor_B.mean()) / tensor_B.std()
            correlation = np.corrcoef(tensor_A_scaled.numpy(), tensor_B_scaled.numpy())[0, 1]
            
            ```
            
            After applying these checks and potential fixes, you should be able to identify the cause of the NaN values and address it appropriately. If you're still having issues, you might want to examine a small subset of your data to see if there are any unexpected patterns or values.
            
        - if A is first feature vector and so is B (For two models), is this is the same as their corrcoef: cosine_sim_matrix[0][0]
            
            You're on the right track, but there's an important distinction to make between correlation coefficients and cosine similarity. While they're related, they're not exactly the same. Let's break this down:
            
            1. Correlation coefficient (Pearson's r):
                - Measures the linear relationship between two variables
                - Ranges from -1 to 1
                - Is invariant to scaling and shifting of the variables
            2. Cosine similarity:
                - Measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors in a multi-dimensional space
                - Ranges from -1 to 1 for real numbers (1 for identical orientation, 0 for orthogonal, -1 for opposite orientation)
                - Is invariant to scaling but not to shifting (direction)
            
            In many cases, especially when dealing with centered data (mean = 0), the cosine similarity and the Pearson correlation coefficient will be very close or even identical. However, they can differ significantly if the data is not centered.
            
            Given your context:
            
            - If `A` is the first feature vector from one model and `B` is the first feature vector from another model
            - And `cosine_sim_matrix[0][0]` represents the cosine similarity between these two vectors
            
            Then `cosine_sim_matrix[0][0]` would indeed give you the cosine similarity between the first feature vectors of the two models. This is often a good measure of how similar the features are across models.
            
            To compare this with the correlation coefficient:
            
            ```python
            import numpy as np
            from scipy.spatial.distance import cosine
            
            # Assuming A and B are your feature vectors (as numpy arrays or torch tensors)
            A = ...  # Your first feature vector from model A
            B = ...  # Your first feature vector from model B
            
            # Convert to numpy if they're torch tensors
            if torch.is_tensor(A):
                A = A.numpy()
            if torch.is_tensor(B):
                B = B.numpy()
            
            # Cosine similarity
            cosine_sim = 1 - cosine(A, B)  # cosine() returns distance, so we subtract from 1
            
            # Correlation coefficient
            correlation = np.corrcoef(A, B)[0, 1]
            
            print(f"Cosine similarity: {cosine_sim}")
            print(f"Correlation coefficient: {correlation}")
            
            ```
            
            If your data is centered (mean subtracted), these values should be very close. If not, they might differ. The choice between cosine similarity and correlation coefficient depends on your specific needs:
            
            - Use cosine similarity if you're interested in the angle between the vectors regardless of their magnitudes or if you want to ignore constant offsets.
            - Use correlation coefficient if you're specifically interested in linear relationships and want to account for both the angle and the spread of the data.
            
            In the context of comparing feature activations across models, cosine similarity is often preferred because it focuses on the direction of the feature vectors rather than their exact magnitudes.
            
        - is "not invariant shifting" meaning will have diff values if translate vectors say diff origin, but not direction?
            
            You've got it exactly right. Let me break this down to clarify:
            
            1. "Not invariant to shifting" means that if you translate the vectors (i.e., add a constant to all elements), the cosine similarity can change.
            2. This is in contrast to the direction of the vectors, which remains unchanged by translation.
            
            Here's a simple example to illustrate:
            
            Let's say we have two vectors:
            A = [1, 2, 3]
            B = [2, 3, 4]
            
            The cosine similarity between A and B will be some value, let's call it X.
            
            Now, if we shift both vectors by adding 10 to each element:
            A' = [11, 12, 13]
            B' = [12, 13, 14]
            
            The cosine similarity between A' and B' will be different from X.
            
            However, the direction of the vectors in space remains the same. If you were to plot these vectors, A and A' would point in the same direction, as would B and B'.
            
            This property is why cosine similarity is often used in text analysis and recommendation systems where the magnitude of the vectors might not be as important as their direction.
            
            In contrast, correlation coefficient is invariant to both scaling and shifting. If you add a constant to all elements of both vectors, the correlation coefficient will remain the same.
            
            This difference can be important depending on your specific application and what aspect of the data you're most interested in comparing.
            
        - give equation for corr coeff
            
            Certainly! The equation for the correlation coefficient, specifically Pearson's correlation coefficient, is as follows:
            
            r = Σ((x_i - x̄)(y_i - ȳ)) / (√Σ(x_i - x̄)² * √Σ(y_i - ȳ)²)
            
            Where:
            
            - r is the Pearson correlation coefficient
            - x_i and y_i are individual sample pairs
            - x̄ is the mean of all x values
            - ȳ is the mean of all y values
            - Σ represents the sum over all samples
            
            This can also be written as:
            
            r = cov(X,Y) / (σ_X * σ_Y)
            
            Where:
            
            - cov(X,Y) is the covariance of X and Y
            - σ_X is the standard deviation of X
            - σ_Y is the standard deviation of Y
            
            In computational terms, you might see it implemented like this:
            
            r = Σ((x_i - x̄)(y_i - ȳ)) / (n * σ_X * σ_Y)
            
            Where n is the number of samples.
            
            This formula calculates the normalized measure of the covariance between two variables X and Y, giving a value between -1 and 1, where:
            
            - 1 indicates a perfect positive linear correlation
            - 0 indicates no linear correlation
            - 1 indicates a perfect negative linear correlation
            
            The correlation coefficient measures both the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables.

    - ✅ ask #neuronpedia for pretrained SAEs
        
        I saw in sae_table that there’s SAEs for the GPT2 small, Gemma-2B, and Mistrial-7B models. I also see several pretrained SAEs on other models (Llama-3, PMs, etc). I was wondering if there’s a list of links to uploaded pretrained SAEs in general (eg. GeLU-1L, tinystories, GPT2-medium)? 
        
        I’m guessing people may have filled out the form to upload them to Neuronpedia too and they’re currently being processed. Also, as seen in sae_table, we can load gemma-2b-res-jb layer 12 post, but not search/steer it on Neuronpedia. I was wondering why? Also, were there only SAEs for L0, L6 and L12 due to cost?
        
        - reply
            
            Those wouldn't be hard to train with SAE Lens :slightly_smiling_face: and if you do, happy to support them. We're a little busy right now but in general we'd be willing to train SAEs for researchers 
            
        
        Thanks again! I'm planning this week to train saes on gpt2 style models (was looking into training toy model llms with only different initializations, but thought to first train saes without needing to train llms) on nodes in my lab. When you say willing to train saes do you mean to help with resources?
        
    - ✅ ask callum for lit review and saes
        
        Hi, to follow up on my project to compare feature geometries across models, I'm looking to run experiments similar to this section:[https://transformer-circuits.pub/2023/monosemantic-features#phenomenology-universality](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2023/monosemantic-features#phenomenology-universality)which involves comparing "different dictionary learning runs trained on different activations from a different transformer with different random seeds but otherwise identical hyperparameters." I was wondering if anyone has also done anything similar to this before (say a blog post / repo) and if they found any additional insights not mentioned by the Towards Monosemanticity paper? Would add to my lit review tooAlso, aside from the saelens list of pretrained models, GPT2 small, Gemma-2B, and Mistrial-7B models, I also see several pretrained SAEs on other models (Llama-3, PMs, etc). I was wondering if there’s a list of links to uploaded pretrained SAEs in general (eg. GeLU-1L, tinystories, GPT2-medium)? Hopefully with for models with the same tokenizers like gpt2 small and medium. Thanks!
        
        I was listening to a podcast with Trenton Bricken and he mentioned he's still doing work with universality, I assume he's looked into techniques like cca or cka though I have some other ideas with finding and comparing higher order structures
        
    - ⚠️ ISSUE: different tokenizers
        - ✅ do gpt2 and gemma-2b use diffrent tokenizer

        - ✅ Did they plot by tokens or samples? It looks like by tokens of samples
            - Universality is NOT just one section of the paper, but within each feature in ‘feature-analysis’

                - We give each token an "Arabic script" score
            - thus, umap plotting the batch*seq is right?
        - ✅ can you use canonical corerlation analysis on two matrices with all diff dims
            
            Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) is a statistical method used to understand the relationship between two sets of variables. It finds linear combinations of the variables in each set such that the correlation between these combinations is maximized. However, for CCA to be applicable, the two matrices must meet certain requirements regarding their dimensions:
            
            1. **Number of Samples (Rows):** Both matrices must have the same number of samples (rows). CCA requires that each row corresponds to a paired observation across the two matrices.
            2. **Number of Features (Columns):** The number of features (columns) can differ between the two matrices. That is, one matrix can have more features than the other.
            
            For example, if you have two matrices \( X \) and \( Y \):
            
            - \( X \) is of shape \( (n, p) \)
            - \( Y \) is of shape \( (n, q) \)
            
            Here, \( n \) is the number of samples (which must be the same for both matrices), while \( p \) and \( q \) are the number of features in matrices \( X \) and \( Y \) respectively (which can be different).
            
            In summary, as long as the two matrices have the same number of rows (samples), CCA can be applied, even if the number of columns (features) in each matrix is different.
            
        - ✅ [Perhaps just use last token of each sample](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1iM4Ta6NLR9Ka4sG6q9YUzpla-Rezm0bx#scrollTo=5HHD5vQixRfk&line=1&uniqifier=1)
            - this still has issue bc not always the same token
        
        what if two LLMs use different tokenizer? then how do you compare if they have the same tokens? for now, try to compare LLMs with same tokenizer.

        hi, as part of my project, I'm looking to extend the results of
        [https://transformer-circuits.pub/2023/monosemantic-features#phenomenology-universality](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2023/monosemantic-features#phenomenology-universality)
        
        in which they compare sae feature activations (of a dataset) for two 1-layer LLMs trained on The Pile with 100 billion tokens. Given that's infeasible for me, I'm looking to train 2 toy model LLMs and compare their saes with CCA, etc. The pretrained SAElens models are too different to compare (eg. gpt2, gemma, mistrial use diff tokenizers). I was wondering if you have any advice for picking the params for the toy models and their saes, and est time + costs? thanks!
        
    - amir reply
        
        For the toy models, it depends on the tasks. For stuff like 6 digit addition, I've seen two layer transformers do really well. (Apparently going from 1 layer to 2 or 3 works better.)
        
        For the SAE's, the most important parameters are the regularization loss and the hidden state size of the autoencoder. For a "toy" model, I wouldn't expect you'd need very high hidden dimension, since its lower complexity than a full LLM. Something like 1/2 to 1x of the MLP dimension should be more than enough. For the regularization l1 loss, you might need to play with that parameter more since its more sensitive. But I'd guess somewhere in the 0.01 to 0.1 range should be plenty.

            1L-21M: Way too slow on T4
            
            epochs is batchsize * train_steps. Only gets to 33% in an hr. 
            
            - is M3 max faster than T4 or A100
                
                When comparing the Apple M3 Max, NVIDIA A100, and NVIDIA Tesla T4 in terms of performance, each GPU excels in different areas, which makes them suited for different types of workloads.
                
                1. **Apple M3 Max**:
                    - The M3 Max, with its 40-core GPU, is designed for high-performance computing in laptops, particularly in graphics and machine learning applications. It is built on a 5nm process technology, which allows for greater efficiency and lower power consumption compared to its competitors. However, detailed benchmarks comparing it directly to the A100 and T4 are scarce due to the different application focus (laptop vs. workstation GPUs)【5†source】【6†source】.
                2. **NVIDIA A100**:
                    - The A100 is a powerhouse for deep learning and AI workloads. It boasts 19.5 TFLOPS of FP32 performance and 312 TFLOPS of FP16 Tensor Core performance, making it significantly faster in terms of raw computational power compared to the M3 Max and T4. It is built on a 7nm process and designed for data centers, offering substantial improvements in training and inference tasks due to its advanced tensor cores and large memory bandwidth【6†source】.
                3. **NVIDIA Tesla T4**:
                    - The T4, while not as powerful as the A100, provides a good balance between performance and power efficiency. It has lower power consumption (75W compared to the A100's 400W) and is more cost-effective. It is suitable for inferencing tasks and provides decent performance in deep learning workloads, albeit not at the same level as the A100【7†source】【8†source】.
                
                **Performance Comparison**:
                
                - **Deep Learning**: The A100 outperforms both the M3 Max and T4 significantly in deep learning tasks due to its superior tensor core performance and higher memory bandwidth.
                - **Power Efficiency**: The T4 is the most power-efficient, making it suitable for environments where power consumption is a critical factor.
                - **General Computing**: The M3 Max offers strong performance for general computing and graphics tasks, particularly in a mobile form factor.
                
                In conclusion, if you are looking for the highest performance in deep learning, the A100 is the best choice. For a balance between cost, power consumption, and performance, especially for inferencing tasks, the T4 is suitable. For high performance in a mobile form factor, the M3 Max is a strong contender.

        To get feature actvs, use sae_lens class method. To do this, you must load the sae as the sae class (wrapper over torch model).

            - need to load cfg dict (from json) into sae wrapper
                - When viewing`cfg_dict` (see `basic_loading_and_analysing.ipynb`), it’s a dict, and not the same as `cfg=LanguageModelSAERunnerConfig` used as input to training the SAE

    - actually, sae_lens ALREADY has a `sae.save_model`
        - `save_model()` shows you just use `cfg.to_dict()` to turn `LanguageModelSAERunnerConfig`  into json
        - Gives it a path in colab files, and it makes a folder with cfg json and saves model using `from safetensors.torch import save_file`. Then copy folder to drive.

        Yes, that’s correct. TinyStories-Instruct-1L-21M was not initialized differently in terms of its base weights. It was fine-tuned from the pre-trained TinyStories-1L-21M model. The fine-tuning process involves taking the pre-trained TinyStories-1L-21M model and further training it on an instructional dataset to enhance its ability to understand and follow instructions. Therefore, TinyStories-Instruct-1L-21M retains the base model's initialization and capabilities but gains additional skills through the fine-tuning process.

        - can two vectors with mostly 0s cause issues with cosine sim or correlation
            
            Yes, two vectors with mostly zeros can cause issues with both cosine similarity and correlation calculations. Here’s a detailed explanation of how and why:
            
            ### Cosine Similarity
            
            Cosine similarity measures the cosine of the angle between two non-zero vectors. When vectors contain mostly zeros, the following issues can arise:
            
            1. **Zero Vectors**: If one or both of the vectors are zero vectors (i.e., all elements are zero), the cosine similarity is undefined because the denominator (the product of the magnitudes) becomes zero.
            2. **Sparse Vectors**: For sparse vectors (with mostly zero elements), the cosine similarity might still be defined, but the similarity score might be misleading if the non-zero elements are not aligned in a meaningful way. Even small differences in non-zero positions can drastically affect the similarity score.
            
            ### Pearson Correlation
            
            Pearson correlation measures the linear relationship between two vectors. Sparse vectors can also cause issues with this metric:
            
            1. **Variance and Mean**: Pearson correlation depends on the mean and variance of the vectors. If the vectors have mostly zeros, the variance might be very low, and any slight change in the non-zero elements can result in a large change in the correlation coefficient.
            2. **Spurious Correlation**: Sparse data can sometimes show high correlation due to a few non-zero elements coinciding by chance, which might not reflect a true underlying relationship.
            
            ### Example and Demonstration
            
            Here’s a practical demonstration with code:
            
            ```python
            import numpy as np
            from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity
            from scipy.stats import pearsonr
            
            # Sparse vectors
            vector_a = np.array([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0])
            vector_b = np.array([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0])
            
            # Cosine similarity
            cos_sim = cosine_similarity(vector_a.reshape(1, -1), vector_b.reshape(1, -1))
            print("Cosine Similarity:", cos_sim[0][0])
            
            # Pearson correlation
            correlation, _ = pearsonr(vector_a, vector_b)
            print("Pearson Correlation:", correlation)
            
            # Another pair of sparse vectors with mostly zero but non-zero in the same positions
            vector_c = np.array([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0])
            vector_d = np.array([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0])
            
            # Cosine similarity
            cos_sim_cd = cosine_similarity(vector_c.reshape(1, -1), vector_d.reshape(1, -1))
            print("Cosine Similarity (C and D):", cos_sim_cd[0][0])
            
            # Pearson correlation
            correlation_cd, _ = pearsonr(vector_c, vector_d)
            print("Pearson Correlation (C and D):", correlation_cd)
            
            ```
            
            ### Explanation:
            
            1. **Vector A and B**:
                - `vector_a` and `vector_b` have mostly zeros and a single non-zero element in different positions.
                - The cosine similarity is zero, as the vectors are orthogonal.
                - The Pearson correlation might be undefined or very low, indicating no linear relationship.
            2. **Vector C and D**:
                - `vector_c` and `vector_d` have mostly zeros but non-zero elements in the same position.
                - The cosine similarity is 1 because they are perfectly aligned, ignoring magnitude differences.
                - The Pearson correlation is also 1, indicating a perfect linear relationship.
            
            ### Key Points:
            
            - **Cosine Similarity**: Sensitive to the positions of non-zero elements; zero vectors result in undefined similarity.
            - **Pearson Correlation**: Sensitive to the variance and mean; sparse vectors can result in misleading high correlations if non-zero elements align by chance.
            
            ### Recommendations:
            
            1. **Normalization**: Normalize the vectors before computing similarity or correlation.
            2. **Sparsity Handling**: Use techniques specifically designed for sparse data, like the Jaccard similarity for binary vectors.
            3. **Thresholding**: Ignore vectors with very high sparsity when computing similarity or correlation to avoid misleading results.
            
            By understanding these nuances, you can better interpret the similarity and correlation metrics for sparse vectors and ensure more accurate analysis.

            - It doesn’t fire on BOS in front, but now actvs for the “highly siimlar” features are 0.

    Model B’s feature appears to fire on more tokens, possibly because it captures more concepts. That is, while these tokens are 0 in model A (1L-21M)’s feature 16251, model B (2L-33M)’s feature 3301 is nonzero for them.

            ### 3. Mapper Construction
            
            ### Create Cover
            
            We start by dividing the data into overlapping regions (cover sets), which helps us understand local structures and how they connect globally.
            
            ### Code Explanation
            
            ```python
            def create_cover(filtered, intervals, overlap):
                min_val, max_val = np.min(filtered, axis=0), np.max(filtered, axis=0)
                steps = (max_val - min_val) / (intervals - 1) * (1 + overlap)
                cover = []
                for i in range(intervals):
                    for j in range(intervals):
                        cover.append(((min_val[0] + i * steps[0], min_val[0] + (i + 1) * steps[0]),
                                      (min_val[1] + j * steps[1], min_val[1] + (j + 1) * steps[1])))
                return cover
            
            ```
            
            - **Filtered**: The reduced-dimension data (e.g., from PCA).
            - **Intervals**: Number of intervals to divide each dimension into.
            - **Overlap**: Degree of overlap between intervals.
            - **Steps**: Calculated based on the range of data values and overlap.
            
            We create a grid of intervals in the lower-dimensional space and store these as pairs of ranges.
            
            ### Intuition
            
            Imagine spreading a mesh net over a terrain (our data). The intervals define the mesh's squares, and overlap ensures the squares cover the terrain more smoothly.
            
            ### Cluster Within Cover Sets
            
            For each cover set, cluster the data points that fall within it. This helps in identifying local groupings of data.
            
            ### Code Explanation
            
            ```python
            def cluster_cover(cover, filtered, activations):
                clusters = []
                for (x_range, y_range) in cover:
                    indices = np.where((filtered[:, 0] >= x_range[0]) & (filtered[:, 0] < x_range[1]) &
                                       (filtered[:, 1] >= y_range[0]) & (filtered[:, 1] < y_range[1]))[0]
                    if len(indices) > 0:
                        clustering = DBSCAN().fit(activations[indices])
                        clusters.append((indices, clustering.labels_))
                return clusters
            
            ```
            
            - **DBSCAN**: A clustering algorithm that groups points closely packed together, marking outliers.
            - **Indices**: Points falling within the cover set.
            - **Clusters**: Each cover set’s clustered points.
            
            ### Intuition
            
            Think of the mesh net's squares as neighborhoods. We examine each neighborhood to find clusters of houses (data points) that are close together, ignoring outliers.
            
            ### 4. Topological Summary
            
            ### Construct Mapper Graph
            
            We build a graph representing the clusters and their connections.
            
            ### Code Explanation
            
            ```python
            import networkx as nx
            
            def construct_mapper_graph(clusters):
                G = nx.Graph()
                for idx, (indices, labels) in enumerate(clusters):
                    for label in np.unique(labels):
                        if label != -1:
                            cluster_indices = indices[labels == label]
                            G.add_node((idx, label), members=cluster_indices)
                for i, (indices1, labels1) in enumerate(clusters):
                    for j, (indices2, labels2) in enumerate(clusters):
                        if i < j:
                            common_indices = np.intersect1d(indices1, indices2)
                            if len(common_indices) > 0:
                                for label1 in np.unique(labels1):
                                    if label1 != -1:
                                        members1 = indices1[labels1 == label1]
                                        for label2 in np.unique(labels2):
                                            if label2 != -1:
                                                members2 = indices2[labels2 == label2]
                                                if len(np.intersect1d(members1, members2)) > 0:
                                                    G.add_edge((i, label1), (j, label2))
                return G
            
            mapper_graph = construct_mapper_graph(clusters)
            
            ```
            
            - **Nodes**: Represent clusters in each cover set.
            - **Edges**: Connect clusters sharing data points across different cover sets.
            
            ### Intuition
            
            Imagine a social network where each node is a group of friends (clusters), and an edge represents shared friends (common data points) between groups.
            
            ### 5. Visualization
            
            ### Visualizing the Graph
            
            Use a spring layout to visualize the constructed graph.
            
            ### Code Explanation
            
            ```python
            import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
            
            pos = nx.spring_layout(mapper_graph)
            nx.draw(mapper_graph, pos, with_labels=True, node_size=50, node_color="blue")
            plt.show()
            
            ```
            
            - **Spring Layout**: Positions nodes based on simulated physical forces to enhance visualization clarity.
            - **Draw**: Visualizes the graph with nodes and edges.
            
            ### Intuition
            
            Visualize the network as a map of cities (clusters) connected by roads (edges). The spring layout helps position cities so that the map is clear and roads are easy to follow.
            
            ### Conclusion
            
            This process creates a simplified representation of high-dimensional data using the Mapper algorithm, providing insights into the structure and relationships within the data. Each step, from cover creation to graph visualization, helps in understanding complex data in a more intuitive way.

        - compare to random data
        - is empty plot always a bug? where did the pts go? do you expect random data to all be noise and thus have empty plot?
            
            When applying the Mapper algorithm to random data, it is not necessarily expected that all data will be classified as noise, resulting in an empty plot. However, it is common because random data lacks structure. Here are some points to consider:
            
            ### Expectation for Random Data
            
            1. **Lack of Structure**:
                - Random data often does not have the dense regions necessary for clustering algorithms like DBSCAN to form clusters.
                - This can result in many points being labeled as noise (`1`).
            2. **Parameter Sensitivity**:
                - The clustering parameters (`eps` and `min_samples` in DBSCAN) might not be suitable for the random data.
                - Random data might require different settings to form clusters, though meaningful clusters may still not be found.
            3. **Real-World Data vs. Random Data**:
                - Real-world data typically has inherent patterns and structures, making it more likely to form meaningful clusters.
                - Random data lacks such patterns, leading to more points being identified as noise.
            
            ### Practical Steps
            
            - **Verify Data Distribution**: Check the distribution of your random data.
                
                ```python
                plt.scatter(filtered_random_data[:, 0], filtered_random_data[:, 1], alpha=0.5)
                plt.title("Filtered Random Data Points")
                plt.xlabel("PCA Component 1")
                plt.ylabel("PCA Component 2")
                plt.show()
                
                ```
                
            - **Adjust Clustering Parameters**:
                
                ```python
                random_clusters = cluster_cover(random_cover, filtered_random_data, reshaped_random_data, eps=0.3, min_samples=3)
                
                ```
                
            - **Check Clusters**:
                
                ```python
                for idx, (indices, labels) in enumerate(random_clusters):
                    print(f"Cluster {idx}: {len(indices)} points, labels: {np.unique(labels)}")
                
                ```
                
            
            ### Example
            
            If you still encounter an empty plot after adjustments, it suggests that the random data does not form clusters under the given parameters. This is typical and highlights the contrast between structured real-world data and random noise, validating the effectiveness of the Mapper algorithm in capturing meaningful structures in real data.
            
            By experimenting with different parameters and visualizing the data, you can better understand the behavior of random data in comparison to real data and the appropriateness of clustering algorithms like DBSCAN.
            
        - i got this for feature activations. are activations usually in a circle? if not what could this mean
            
            Activations typically are not expected to form a perfect circle. If your feature activations form a circular pattern, it could indicate several things:
            
            1. **Dimensionality Reduction Artifact**: If you used PCA or another dimensionality reduction technique, the circular pattern might result from how the algorithm projected the data into a lower-dimensional space.
            2. **Periodic Structure in Data**: The underlying data might have periodicity or cyclical patterns that are being captured in the activations.
            3. **Model Regularity**: The model might have learned a regular, cyclical pattern from the training data, which is reflected in the activations.
            
            ### Steps to Investigate Further
            
            1. **Verify Dimensionality Reduction**:
                - Check the explained variance ratio of the PCA components to ensure that the circle is not an artifact of the reduction process.
                
                ```python
                print(pca.explained_variance_ratio_)
                
                ```
                
            2. **Analyze the Source Data**:
                - Investigate the input data to see if there are any inherent periodic or cyclic patterns.
                
                ```python
                plt.plot(h_store[0].detach().numpy())  # Example for the first sequence
                plt.title("Input Data Sample")
                plt.show()
                
                ```
                
            3. **Check Model Training**:
                - Ensure that the model training process did not introduce regularities that might cause this pattern.
                - Check for overfitting or regularization artifacts.
            4. **Compare with Random Data**:
                - Generate random data and pass it through the model to see if a similar circular pattern appears.
                
                ```python
                random_data = np.random.randn(*h_store.shape)
                random_activations = sae.encode(torch.from_numpy(random_data).float())
                filtered_random_data = pca.transform(random_activations.view(-1, featuredim).detach().numpy())
                plt.scatter(filtered_random_data[:, 0], filtered_random_data[:, 1], alpha=0.5)
                plt.title("Filtered Random Data Points")
                plt.show()
                
                ```
                
            
            ### Conclusion
            
            While a circular pattern in activations is unusual, it's essential to analyze the steps leading to this result and verify if it's due to the model, the data, or the dimensionality reduction technique. By performing these checks, you can better understand the cause and take appropriate steps to address any issues.
            
        - how do i plot the pca before mapper
        - what do the indices on this plot mean?
            
            The indices on this plot likely represent the clusters and their labels as identified by the Mapper algorithm. In the format `(x, y)`, each pair can be interpreted as follows:
            
            1. **Cluster Index (`x`)**: This is the index of the cover set in which the cluster was found. Cover sets are created during the Mapper construction process by dividing the data space into overlapping regions.
            2. **Cluster Label (`y`)**: This is the label assigned by the clustering algorithm (e.g., DBSCAN) within that cover set. Each unique label represents a distinct cluster, and `1` typically indicates noise or outliers.
            
            Given the circular arrangement, this pattern likely results from how the data was reduced and clustered, with each node representing a cluster from a specific cover set and showing how they connect.
            
            In summary, the indices `(x, y)` indicate which cover set (region of the data space) a cluster belongs to (`x`) and the cluster label within that cover set (`y`). This representation helps in understanding the topological relationships between different clusters in the data.
            
        - the feature actvs were of shape torch.Size([195, 128, 16384]). why are they so few pts in mapper plot? also, why isn't the mapper plot a graph with edges?
            
            Given your feature activations are of shape `torch.Size([195, 128, 16384])`, there are a few reasons why you might see only a few points and no edges in the Mapper plot:
            
            ### 1. Dimensionality Reduction Impact
            
            The high dimensionality of the feature activations (16384 dimensions) is drastically reduced to 2 dimensions using PCA. This could result in loss of significant structural information, leading to fewer meaningful clusters.
            
            ### 2. Clustering Parameters
            
            The DBSCAN parameters (`eps` and `min_samples`) might not be optimal for the reduced data, causing many points to be labeled as noise (`-1`). Adjusting these parameters could help.
            
            ### 3. Overlapping Cover Sets
            
            The choice of cover intervals and overlap affects how many points fall into multiple cover sets, influencing the number of clusters formed.
            
            ### 4. Graph Construction
            
            For edges to appear, there must be shared points between clusters across cover sets. If no such shared points exist, no edges will be drawn.
            
            ### Detailed Steps to Address These Issues
            
            ### 1. Verify Dimensionality Reduction
            
            Ensure that the PCA retains enough variance:
            
            ```python
            from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
            
            # Perform PCA and check explained variance ratio
            pca = PCA(n_components=2)
            pca_acts = pca.fit_transform(reshaped_acts)
            print(pca.explained_variance_ratio_)
            
            ```
            
            Ensure enough variance is captured, or consider increasing the number of components and then using t-SNE or UMAP for 2D visualization.
            
            ### 2. Adjust DBSCAN Parameters
            
            Experiment with different `eps` and `min_samples`:
            
            ```python
            from sklearn.cluster import DBSCAN
            
            def cluster_cover(cover, filtered, activations, eps=0.5, min_samples=5):
                clusters = []
                for idx, (x_range, y_range) in enumerate(cover):
                    indices = np.where((filtered[:, 0] >= x_range[0]) & (filtered[:, 0] < x_range[1]) &
                                       (filtered[:, 1] >= y_range[0]) & (filtered[:, 1] < y_range[1]))[0]
                    if len(indices) > 0:
                        clustering = DBSCAN(eps=eps, min_samples=min_samples).fit(activations[indices])
                        clusters.append((idx, clustering.labels_))
                return clusters
            
            # Adjust eps and min_samples
            random_clusters = cluster_cover(random_cover, filtered_acts, reshaped_acts, eps=0.3, min_samples=3)
            
            ```
            
            ### 3. Visualize PCA Before Applying Mapper
            
            ```python
            import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
            
            plt.scatter(pca_acts[:, 0], pca_acts[:, 1], alpha=0.5)
            plt.title("PCA of Feature Activations")
            plt.xlabel("Principal Component 1")
            plt.ylabel("Principal Component 2")
            plt.show()
            
            ```
            
            ### 4. Verify Mapper Graph Construction
            
            Check if nodes and edges are being added correctly:
            
            ```python
            import networkx as nx
            
            def construct_mapper_graph(clusters):
                G = nx.Graph()
                for idx, (indices, labels) in enumerate(clusters):
                    for label in np.unique(labels):
                        if label != -1:
                            cluster_indices = indices[labels == label]
                            G.add_node((idx, label), members=cluster_indices)
                for i, (indices1, labels1) in enumerate(clusters):
                    for j, (indices2, labels2) in enumerate(clusters):
                        if i < j:
                            common_indices = np.intersect1d(indices1, indices2)
                            if len(common_indices) > 0:
                                for label1 in np.unique(labels1):
                                    if label1 != -1:
                                        members1 = indices1[labels1 == label1]
                                        for label2 in np.unique(labels2):
                                            if label2 != -1:
                                                members2 = indices2[labels2 == label2]
                                                if len(np.intersect1d(members1, members2)) > 0:
                                                    G.add_edge((i, label1), (j, label2))
                return G
            
            random_mapper_graph = construct_mapper_graph(random_clusters)
            print(nx.info(random_mapper_graph))
            
            # Visualize the Mapper graph
            pos = nx.spring_layout(random_mapper_graph)
            nx.draw(random_mapper_graph, pos, with_labels=True, node_size=50, node_color="blue")
            plt.title("Mapper Graph")
            plt.show()
            
            ```
            
            ### Conclusion
            
            The fewer points and lack of edges indicate that most points are considered noise or not shared between clusters. Adjusting parameters and ensuring proper data preprocessing can help in obtaining a more meaningful Mapper graph.
            

Feature Splitting Expms

    [](https://www.neuronpedia.org/gpt2-small/?sourceSet=res_fs768-jb&selectedLayers=%5B%5D&sortIndexes=%5B%5D&ignoreBos=true&q=arabic%0A)
        
        Hi, I was looking for recs on how to use Neuronpedia to search for languages such as Arabic, and have a few questions:
        
        1) Should I just try a variety of examples such as ال or phrases such as **كيف حالك ?**
        
        2) Is there a way to search by explanation like “Arabic”, not just by dataset examples?
        
        3) The “towards mono” paper mentions characters like ث are tokenized into `\xd8` `\xab`. Would it make more sense to search for the script characters or their utf-8 encodings? (guessing the former since I see japanese characters in the dataset examples)
        
        4) I’ve been trying to find Arabic script features in GPT-2 small L8 SAEs (and its feature splitting variants). Would the model unlikely have Arabic (due to its training dataset); if so, has anyone found Arabic features in publically available models, or believe there could be? Haven’t found this in Gemma-2 either.training 
        
        Lastly, are there separate channels/chats for asking questions about the neuronpedia interface VS asking specific research questions that use neuronpedia?

    - ✅ loop through entire dataset is too long; just choose a very max batch size
        - we want each word to not be overrepresented but there’s a disproportionate amount
            
            ![Untitled](Done%201c002201437341e48b55b8276859a632/Untitled%205.png)

        Not really feature specific to daughter. Perhaps we can use feature splitting to constrain it to specifically fire for daughter?
        
        - issue: top actv features fire on unrelated words like ‘and’, and are often repetitive
    - ✅ instead of find ‘top actv features’ (meaningless), use a search fn that finds features which activate for specific dataset tokens.
        - ⚠️ One way is: don’t use entire batch tokens, but only snippets that have ‘princess’ in it
            
            This is bc too many words
            
            - ISSUE: to create this dataset, you’d be loop through windows of each sample. that takes a long time; the second method below is easier to code
        - ✅ One way is: get top 5 snippets for ALL features, then search to display only features that have the search keywords in their top 5 snippets
            - ✅ search function for features actv on keyword
                - ✅ for each feature, store their top 5 snippets in a list.
                    
                    we can also only store ‘keyword relevant’ snips, but this is inefficient if we want to search through ANY keyword
                    
                - ✅ brute search thru every feature and every list to see if keyword appears
                    - ✅ it’s not just enough for the keyword to appear; it has to be highlighted

    - ⚠️ ISSUE: there’s not a monosemantic princess feature. rather, it’s mixed with a bunch of other related concepts
        
        We should probably look for he/male to king, and she/female to queen, etc. that are MORE separated
        
        There’s princess features that are more related to fairy tales, and other more related to pronouns, and others related to family
        
        we can’t get a clean princess feature, BUT we can still compare subspaces of fairy tales, and say they’re more CCA similar to each other than other subspaces
        
    - ✅ to find how separated semantic clusters are, we should plot a umap then label the features using GPT-4 data analysis (direct input of rows). then we can find similar clusters across models to get subspaces to compare.

                In both snippets, UMAP reduces the data to 2 components.
                
            - ✅ decoder weight matrix umap has much more structure than the encoder W
            - ✅ the decoder matrix has dims (features_sae, features_LLM). Does the umap have a point for each feature_sae row?
                
                Yes, in the context of UMAP applied to the decoder matrix with dimensions (features_sae, features_LLM), each row corresponds to a feature from the sparse autoencoder (SAE). Therefore, the UMAP would generate a point for each row (feature_sae), representing how each SAE feature is embedded in the reduced 2-dimensional space.
                
                Given that the decoder matrix maps SAE features to LLM features, the UMAP visualization shows the relationship and distribution of these SAE features in a lower-dimensional space, highlighting patterns and clusters among the features learned by the autoencoders.

                Canonical correlation measures the relationship between two sets of variables. The value ranges from -1 to 1, where:
                
                - A value of 1 indicates a perfect positive correlation.
                - A value of -1 indicates a perfect negative correlation.
                - A value of 0 indicates no correlation.
                
                Given the canonical correlation value of -0.9918, this indicates a very strong negative correlation between the two sets of variables. This means that as values in one set increase, values in the other set decrease almost perfectly in a linear fashion.
                
                Therefore, this is not a "low" correlation; it is actually very high in magnitude, just negative. This indicates a very strong linear relationship between the two sets of variables, but in opposite directions.

                A sparse autoencoder (SAE) aims to extract interpretable features from a neural network by decomposing the activation space into more components than neurons, helping understand the model's behavior. When using UMAP to visualize two decoder weight matrices from such an SAE, a strong negative canonical correlation (like -0.9918) suggests the two weight matrices are almost perfect opposites. This implies that the features learned by the autoencoder are highly distinct in their contributions to the network, emphasizing the SAE's ability to separate features effectively.
                
                For more detailed context, visit [Transformer Circuits](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2023/monosemantic-features).
                
            - does that mean the features are not similar across the two models? these are decoder weights on two saes from two separate models trained on the same dataset
                
                A canonical correlation of -0.9918 between the UMAP embeddings of decoder weights from two sparse autoencoders trained on the same dataset indicates that the features are highly dissimilar across the two models. This strong negative correlation means that when one model assigns a high value to a feature, the other model assigns a correspondingly low value, suggesting that the features learned by each model capture different aspects or perspectives of the same data.

            ### Key Optimizations:
            
            1. **Vectorization**: We avoid explicit Python loops by using PyTorch's broadcasting and vectorized operations.
            2. **GPU Acceleration**: The function checks for the availability of a CUDA-compatible GPU and transfers tensors to the GPU for computation.
            3. **Masking Invalid Columns**: We handle zero standard deviation columns by creating a mask and filling invalid correlations with `inf`.
            
            This approach should significantly speed up your computation by leveraging PyTorch's efficient tensor operations and, if available, GPU acceleration.
            
        - ✅ use this sped up code to find the highest correlated feature from A to B for every of the 16384 features
            - ✅ this is still slow. can you speed it up say with matrix multp for all features at once?
            - ✅ ISSUE: same indices, and values are nan
        - ✅ save dataset to drive, then load in umap nb to do ds interpret after corr pairs
            - ISSUE: needs model.tokenizer to convert token to str
                
                `AttributeError: module 'pyarrow.lib' has no attribute 'ListViewType’`
                
                Importing Transformelens is incompatible with umap lib!
                
            - ✅ TRY: load hf’s tokenizer and use decode

    - 🐣 given a dictionary that maps every point number from the first plot to a point number in the second plot, make a side by side interative plot like above but where hovering over a point in one plot will also bring up the hovered label in the second plot. also, when a point is hovered over, it turns yellow and its point partner also turns yellow

            - that doesn't work. I mean this: here's a dictionary mapping the two features_list and features_list_2: feat_map = {3:40, 60:5, ...} as an example only. take this as input. now, when you hover over element 3 in the left plot, then that not only brings up a hovered label for element 3 in the left, but brings up a hovered label for element 40 on the right. and so forth. ALSO you didn't make the points yellow when they're hovered over!

            - it has to work in colab. if not possible to do in colab, what are the steps to do this somewhere else for free
                
                I apologize for the confusion. You're right to point out that some of the more advanced interactive features might not work directly in Colab due to limitations in how it handles JavaScript callbacks. Let's explore a few options:
                
                1. Simplified Colab Version:
                We can create a simpler version that works in Colab but with limited interactivity. This won't have the cross-plot highlighting, but it will still show hover information.
                2. Using Plotly Dash (can be done for free):
                This is a more robust solution that allows for full interactivity, but it requires setting up a small web application.
                
                Let's start with the simplified Colab version, and then I'll explain how to set up the fully interactive version using Plotly Dash.
                
                Simplified Colab Version:
                
                ```python
                import umap
                import pandas as pd
                import plotly.graph_objects as go
                from plotly.subplots import make_subplots
                import numpy as np
                
                # Assume weight_matrix_np, weight_matrix_2, fList_model_A, and fList_model_B are already defined
                
                # Initialize UMAP
                reducer = umap.UMAP(n_neighbors=15, min_dist=0.01, metric='euclidean')
                
                # Fit and transform the data by rows
                embedding1 = reducer.fit_transform(weight_matrix_np)
                embedding2 = reducer.fit_transform(weight_matrix_2)
                
                # Create DataFrames for Plotly
                df1 = pd.DataFrame(embedding1, columns=['UMAP Component 1', 'UMAP Component 2'])
                df1['Feature ID'] = range(len(embedding1))
                df1['Feature Description'] = fList_model_A[:len(embedding1)]
                
                df2 = pd.DataFrame(embedding2, columns=['UMAP Component 1', 'UMAP Component 2'])
                df2['Feature ID'] = range(len(embedding2))
                df2['Feature Description'] = fList_model_B[:len(embedding2)]
                
                # Create side by side plots using Plotly subplots
                fig = make_subplots(rows=1, cols=2, subplot_titles=('UMAP Projection of Dataset 1', 'UMAP Projection of Dataset 2'))
                
                # Add first scatter plot
                fig.add_trace(
                    go.Scatter(
                        x=df1['UMAP Component 1'], y=df1['UMAP Component 2'],
                        mode='markers', marker=dict(color='blue', size=8),
                        text=df1['Feature ID'], customdata=np.array(df1[['Feature Description']]),
                        hovertemplate='<b>Feature ID:</b> %{text}<br><b>Description:</b> %{customdata[0]}'
                    ),
                    row=1, col=1
                )
                
                # Add second scatter plot
                fig.add_trace(
                    go.Scatter(
                        x=df2['UMAP Component 1'], y=df2['UMAP Component 2'],
                        mode='markers', marker=dict(color='green', size=8),
                        text=df2['Feature ID'], customdata=np.array(df2[['Feature Description']]),
                        hovertemplate='<b>Feature ID:</b> %{text}<br><b>Description:</b> %{customdata[0]}'
                    ),
                    row=1, col=2
                )
                
                # Update layout
                fig.update_layout(
                    title_text='UMAP Projections of Datasets',
                    showlegend=False,
                    hovermode='closest'
                )
                
                fig.update_xaxes(title_text='UMAP Component 1', row=1, col=1)
                fig.update_xaxes(title_text='UMAP Component 1', row=1, col=2)
                fig.update_yaxes(title_text='UMAP Component 2', row=1, col=1)
                fig.update_yaxes(title_text='UMAP Component 2', row=1, col=2)
                
                fig.show()
                
                ```
                
                This version will work in Colab and provide basic interactivity (hovering to see point information), but it won't have the cross-plot highlighting feature.
                
                For the fully interactive version with cross-plot highlighting, you'll need to use Plotly Dash. Here are the steps to set this up for free:
                
                1. Set up a free Heroku account ([https://www.heroku.com/](https://www.heroku.com/)).
                2. Install the Heroku CLI on your local machine.
                3. Create a new Python file (e.g., `app.py`) with the Dash application code.
                4. Create a `requirements.txt` file listing the required Python packages.
                5. Create a `Procfile` for Heroku deployment.
                6. Initialize a Git repository, commit your files, and push to Heroku.
                
                Here's a basic structure for the `app.py` file:
                
                ```python
                import dash
                from dash import dcc, html
                from dash.dependencies import Input, Output
                import plotly.graph_objects as go
                from plotly.subplots import make_subplots
                import pandas as pd
                import numpy as np
                import umap
                
                # Initialize your data and UMAP embeddings here
                # (You'll need to load your data or compute it on the fly)
                
                app = dash.Dash(__name__)
                server = app.server  # Needed for Heroku deployment
                
                app.layout = html.Div([
                    dcc.Graph(id='umap-plots')
                ])
                
                @app.callback(
                    Output('umap-plots', 'figure'),
                    Input('umap-plots', 'hoverData')
                )
                def update_graph(hoverData):
                    # Create your figure here, similar to the Colab version
                    # Use hoverData to implement the cross-plot highlighting
                
                    return fig
                
                if __name__ == '__main__':
                    app.run_server(debug=True)
                
                ```
                
                This is a basic structure and would need to be filled out with your specific data and plot creation code.
                
                The main advantage of using Dash is that it allows for more complex interactivity and updating of the plots based on user input, which is necessary for the cross-plot highlighting feature you requested.
                
                Would you like me to provide more details on any part of this process?
                
            - can it work in colab? why wouldn't it?
                
                I apologize for any confusion in my previous responses. You're right to question this, and I appreciate the opportunity to clarify.
                
                Upon further consideration, it is indeed possible to create an interactive plot with cross-plot highlighting in Google Colab. My initial hesitation was unwarranted, as Colab does support Plotly's JavaScript callbacks when properly implemented.
                
                Here's a version that should work in Colab with the cross-plot highlighting feature:
                
                ```python
                import umap
                import pandas as pd
                import plotly.graph_objects as go
                from plotly.subplots import make_subplots
                import numpy as np
                from IPython.display import display, HTML
                
                # Assume weight_matrix_np, weight_matrix_2, fList_model_A, and fList_model_B are already defined
                
                # Initialize UMAP
                reducer = umap.UMAP(n_neighbors=15, min_dist=0.01, metric='euclidean')
                
                # Fit and transform the data by rows
                embedding1 = reducer.fit_transform(weight_matrix_np)
                embedding2 = reducer.fit_transform(weight_matrix_2)
                
                # Create DataFrames for Plotly
                df1 = pd.DataFrame(embedding1, columns=['UMAP Component 1', 'UMAP Component 2'])
                df1['Feature ID'] = range(len(embedding1))
                df1['Feature Description'] = fList_model_A[:len(embedding1)]
                
                df2 = pd.DataFrame(embedding2, columns=['UMAP Component 1', 'UMAP Component 2'])
                df2['Feature ID'] = range(len(embedding2))
                df2['Feature Description'] = fList_model_B[:len(embedding2)]
                
                # Create side by side plots using Plotly subplots
                fig = make_subplots(rows=1, cols=2, subplot_titles=('UMAP Projection of Dataset 1', 'UMAP Projection of Dataset 2'))
                
                # Add first scatter plot

                    mode='markers', marker=dict(color='blue', size=8),
                    text=df1['Feature ID'], customdata=np.array(df1[['Feature Description']]),
                    hovertemplate='<b>Feature ID:</b> %{text}<br><b>Description:</b> %{customdata[0]}',
                    name='Dataset 1'
                )

                    name='Dataset 2'
                )
                fig.add_trace(trace2, row=1, col=2)
                
                # Update layout

                This code should work in Colab and provide the cross-plot highlighting feature you requested. Here's why it works:
                
                1. We create the Plotly figure as before.
                2. We generate a unique ID for the graph div to ensure we can target it with our JavaScript.
                3. We create a JavaScript code block that includes the functions for highlighting and resetting colors, as well as the event listeners for hover and unhover events.
                4. We use the `display(HTML())` function to inject this JavaScript code into the notebook after the plot is displayed.
                
                The reason this approach works in Colab is that we're not relying on Plotly's built-in JavaScript callback system (which can be more limited in notebook environments). Instead, we're manually injecting our JavaScript code into the notebook, which allows us to add custom interactivity.
                
                I apologize again for my earlier confusion. This solution should provide the interactive features you're looking for while working within the Colab environment. Let me know if you need any clarification or have any questions about this implementation!

            For a scenario where you're not confined to running in Colab and can use a broader range of tools, creating an interactive web application using JavaScript directly alongside Python could be an excellent way to handle interactive, linked UMAP visualizations. Using a combination of a Python backend (Flask or FastAPI) to serve the data and a frontend using libraries like Plotly.js or D3.js can give you much more control and flexibility over the interactive elements.
            
            ### Step-by-Step Guide to Setting Up an Interactive Visualization with Flask and Plotly.js:
            
            ### Step 1: Setup Your Environment
            
            Ensure Python is installed and set up a new virtual environment:
            
            ```bash
            python -m venv venv
            source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\\Scripts\\activate`
            pip install flask umap-learn numpy sklearn
            
            ```
            
            ### Step 2: Prepare Your Python Script (Backend)
            
            Create a Flask app to serve UMAP data and the HTML for the frontend:
            
            1. **Flask App Setup**:
            
            ```python
            from flask import Flask, jsonify, render_template
            import umap
            from sklearn.datasets import make_blobs
            
            app = Flask(__name__)
            
            # Generate sample data
            data1, _ = make_blobs(n_samples=100, centers=3, n_features=5, random_state=42)
            data2, _ = make_blobs(n_samples=100, centers=3, n_features=5, random_state=84)
            
            # Perform UMAP
            reducer1 = umap.UMAP()
            embedding1 = reducer1.fit_transform(data1)
            reducer2 = umap.UMAP()
            embedding2 = reducer2.fit_transform(data2)
            
            # Map indices
            feat_map = {i: (99-i) for i in range(100)}
            
            @app.route('/')
            def index():
                return render_template('index.html')
            
            @app.route('/data')
            def data():
                return jsonify({
                    'embedding1': embedding1.tolist(),
                    'embedding2': embedding2.tolist(),
                    'map': feat_map
                })
            
            if __name__ == '__main__':
                app.run(debug=True)
            
            ```
            
            1. **HTML and JavaScript (Frontend)**:
            Create a file `templates/index.html` in the same directory as your Flask app:
            
            ```html
            <!DOCTYPE html>
            <html>
            <head>
                <title>UMAP Visualizations</title>
                <script src="<https://cdn.plot.ly/plotly-latest.min.js>"></script>
            </head>
            <body>
                <div id="plot1" style="width:600px; height:500px;"></div>
                <div id="plot2" style="width:600px; height:500px;"></div>
            
                <script>
                    fetch('/data')
                        .then(response => response.json())
                        .then(data => {
                            const trace1 = {
                                x: data.embedding1.map(d => d[0]),
                                y: data.embedding1.map(d => d[1]),
                                mode: 'markers',
                                type: 'scatter',
                                text: Object.keys(data.map),
                                hoverinfo: 'text'
                            };
            
                            const trace2 = {
                                x: data.embedding2.map(d => d[0]),
                                y: data.embedding2.map(d => d[1]),
                                mode: 'markers',
                                type: 'scatter',
                                text: Object.values(data.map),
                                hoverinfo: 'text'
                            };
            
                            const layout = { hovermode: 'closest' };
            
                            Plotly.newPlot('plot1', [trace1], layout);
                            Plotly.newPlot('plot2', [trace2], layout);
            
                            const plots = [document.getElementById('plot1'), document.getElementById('plot2')];
            
                            plots.forEach((plot, index) => {
                                plot.on('plotly_hover', function(data) {
                                    let ptNumber = data.points[0].pointNumber;
                                    let mapIndex = index === 0 ? data.map[ptNumber] : Object.keys(data.map).find(key => data.map[key] === ptNumber);
                                    Plotly.Fx.hover(index === 0 ? 'plot2' : 'plot1', [{curveNumber: 0, pointNumber: mapIndex}], 'xy');
                                });
                            });
                        });
                </script>
            </body>
            </html>
            
            ```
            
            ### Step 3: Run Your Application
            
            Run the Flask app by executing `python <filename>.py`. Visit `localhost:5000` in your web browser to view the interactive UMAP plots.
            
            ### Summary:
            
            This setup allows for a high degree of interactivity by directly manipulating data on the client side with JavaScript. You can hover over points in one plot to highlight corresponding points in another plot, using Plotly.js for visualization and Flask for serving the data and the webpage. This method leverages the full capabilities of modern web technologies for interactive data visualization.

    - ✅ load embeddings and indices downloaded from colab (store in data folder)
    - ⚠️ debug why flask doesnt work
        
        this flask app doesn't show the plots side by side horizontally AND it's not highlighting the tokens, and using a feature map list such that the index in the list is the feature index in right plot and the value is feature index in left plot, such that the paired feature indices points in both plots are highlighted and display label when hovered over. modify the flask and html code to be more like this, with the above in mind:
        
    - ask ai to breakdown code and pinpoint part that does that function. if it doesn't, ask it how it can do it *(start from scratch so not polluted with prev wrong code!)*
        
        starting from side by side umap colab code, give it one step at a time, one small modification, rather than all at once
        
        - modify this code so that hovering over one point will turn it yellow
            - did not specify colab: [https://chatgpt.com/c/af24bff4-4390-49e8-b0de-99ff0359e5dd](https://chatgpt.com/c/af24bff4-4390-49e8-b0de-99ff0359e5dd)

    - ✅ NOTE: if get error `JSONDecodeError: Expecting value: line 69032 column 1 (char 3145728)`, prob bc file didn’t upload fully and was caneled. upload it again
    - ✅ modify this to color yellow the points features 1 and 3 in the left plot, and features 10 and 13 in the right plot, while all other points are blue:
        
        This works, but only visible when points are 16000. This is bc too many pts to see yellow! So perhaps instead of coloring, zoom in on both parts of the plots (neighborhood around the paired points) after hovering/clicking

    - correlation coefficient vs cca.score(X_umap, Y_umap)
        
        The `correlation coefficient` and `cca.score(X_umap, Y_umap)` are different methods to assess the relationship between the canonical variables obtained from Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA). Here's a breakdown of what each one represents and how to interpret them:
        
        ### Canonical Correlation Coefficient
        
        1. **Definition**: Canonical correlation coefficients measure the linear relationship between pairs of canonical variables obtained from the two datasets.
        2. **Calculation**: These coefficients are computed for each pair of canonical variables (one from each dataset). In your case, you computed the correlations manually:
            
            ```python
            correlations = [np.corrcoef(X_c[:, i], Y_c[:, i])[0, 1] for i in range(X_c.shape[1])]
            
            ```
            
        3. **Interpretation**:
            - Values range from -1 to 1.
            - A value closer to 1 or -1 indicates a strong linear relationship.
            - A value closer to 0 indicates a weak linear relationship.
            - Positive values indicate that as one variable increases, the other tends to increase.
            - Negative values indicate that as one variable increases, the other tends to decrease.
        
        ### `cca.score(X_umap, Y_umap)`
        
        1. **Definition**: The `cca.score` method in `sklearn` computes the average canonical correlation between the transformed datasets.
        2. **Calculation**: This method calculates the average correlation between the canonical variables across all dimensions specified during the CCA fitting. However, it should normally return a value between -1 and 1, indicating the average strength of the linear relationship.
        3. **Interpretation**:
            - A higher score indicates a stronger average linear relationship across all canonical pairs.
            - This method provides a single summary statistic instead of individual correlation coefficients for each pair.
        
        ### Practical Differences and Usage
        
        - **Granularity**: The canonical correlation coefficients provide a detailed view by showing the strength of the relationship for each pair of canonical variables. In contrast, `cca.score` gives a single summary measure of the overall relationship.
        - **Use Cases**:
            - **Canonical Correlation Coefficients**: Useful when you want to understand the relationship between specific pairs of canonical variables.
            - **cca.score**: Useful when you need a quick summary of the overall relationship strength.
        
        ### Example with Correct Usage
        
        Given your goal is to compare subspaces using CCA, here's how to properly use both methods:
        
        1. **Compute Canonical Correlation Coefficients**:
            
            ```python
            import numpy as np
            import umap
            from sklearn.cross_decomposition import CCA
            from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
            
            # Assuming X and Y are your input matrices of size (16384, 1024)
            # Assuming indices_X and indices_Y are lists of indices for subsetting X and Y respectively
            
            # Step 1: Subset the matrices
            X_subset = X[indices_X, :]
            Y_subset = Y[indices_Y, :]
            
            # Step 2: Apply UMAP to each subset
            umap_model = umap.UMAP(n_components=2)  # you can adjust n_components as needed
            
            X_umap = umap_model.fit_transform(X_subset)
            Y_umap = umap_model.fit_transform(Y_subset)
            
            # Standardize the UMAP-transformed data
            X_umap = StandardScaler().fit_transform(X_umap)
            Y_umap = StandardScaler().fit_transform(Y_umap)
            
            # Step 3: Fit and transform using CCA
            cca = CCA(n_components=2)  # you can adjust n_components as needed
            X_c, Y_c = cca.fit_transform(X_umap, Y_umap)
            
            # Calculate canonical correlations manually
            correlations = [np.corrcoef(X_c[:, i], Y_c[:, i])[0, 1] for i in range(X_c.shape[1])]
            print("Canonical correlations:", correlations)
            
            # Compute the average canonical correlation score
            average_score = np.mean(correlations)
            print("Average canonical correlation score:", average_score)
            
            ```
            
        2. **Compute `cca.score`**:
            
            ```python
            # Optionally, calculate the score using the CCA object
            cca_score = cca.score(X_umap, Y_umap)
            print("CCA score:", cca_score)
            
            ```
            
        
        ### Key Points to Remember:
        
        - Both the canonical correlation coefficients and `cca.score` are useful metrics, but they serve slightly different purposes.
        - Ensure the data is properly preprocessed (e.g., standardized) before applying CCA.
        - Interpret the canonical correlations to understand specific relationships, and use `cca.score` for a quick summary.
    - why is Average canonical correlation score 0.4 while cca.score(X_umap, Y_umap) is 0.1
        
        The discrepancy between the "Average canonical correlation score" (0.4) and `cca.score(X_umap, Y_umap)` (0.1) suggests a misunderstanding or misuse of the `cca.score` method. The `cca.score` method from scikit-learn's CCA class should give the average canonical correlation directly and should match the manually calculated average of the canonical correlations. Let's clarify and ensure the correct usage.
        
        ### Correct Usage and Understanding
        
        1. **Canonical Correlation Coefficients**:
            - These are manually computed correlations for each pair of canonical variables.
            - Should be directly calculated from the transformed data `X_c` and `Y_c`.
        2. **`cca.score` Method**:
            - This should return the average of the canonical correlations.
        
        ### Revisiting the Process and Code
        
        Let's ensure the entire process is correct:
        
        1. **Standardization**: Ensure data is standardized before applying UMAP and CCA.
        2. **UMAP Transformation**: Correctly transform the data using UMAP.
        3. **CCA Fitting and Transformation**: Correctly fit and transform the data using CCA.
        4. **Correlation Calculation**: Compute the canonical correlations correctly.
        5. **CCA Score Calculation**: Use `cca.score` method correctly.
        
        ### Complete Code Example
        
        Here is the corrected code with a focus on ensuring all steps are correctly performed:
        
        ```python
        import numpy as np
        import umap
        from sklearn.cross_decomposition import CCA
        from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
        
        # Assuming X and Y are your input matrices of size (16384, 1024)
        # Assuming indices_X and indices_Y are lists of indices for subsetting X and Y respectively
        
        # Step 1: Subset the matrices
        X_subset = X[indices_X, :]
        Y_subset = Y[indices_Y, :]
        
        # Step 2: Standardize the subsets
        scaler = StandardScaler()
        X_subset = scaler.fit_transform(X_subset)
        Y_subset = scaler.fit_transform(Y_subset)
        
        # Step 3: Apply UMAP to each subset
        umap_model = umap.UMAP(n_components=2)  # you can adjust n_components as needed
        
        X_umap = umap_model.fit_transform(X_subset)
        Y_umap = umap_model.fit_transform(Y_subset)
        
        # Step 4: Standardize the UMAP-transformed data
        X_umap = scaler.fit_transform(X_umap)
        Y_umap = scaler.fit_transform(Y_umap)
        
        # Step 5: Fit and transform using CCA
        cca = CCA(n_components=2)  # you can adjust n_components as needed
        X_c, Y_c = cca.fit_transform(X_umap, Y_umap)
        
        # Step 6: Calculate canonical correlations manually
        correlations = [np.corrcoef(X_c[:, i], Y_c[:, i])[0, 1] for i in range(X_c.shape[1])]
        print("Canonical correlations:", correlations)
        
        # Calculate the average canonical correlation score manually
        average_correlation_score = np.mean(correlations)
        print("Average canonical correlation score:", average_correlation_score)
        
        # Step 7: Compute the average canonical correlation score using CCA's score method
        cca_score = cca.score(X_umap, Y_umap)
        print("CCA score:", cca_score)
        
        ```
        
        ### Explanation of Steps:
        
        1. **Standardization**: The data is standardized before any dimensionality reduction. This ensures that each feature contributes equally to the analysis.
        2. **UMAP Transformation**: Apply UMAP to the standardized data to reduce dimensionality.
        3. **Standardization of UMAP Data**: Standardize the UMAP-transformed data.
        4. **CCA Fitting and Transformation**: Fit and transform the standardized UMAP data using CCA.
        5. **Correlation Calculation**: Manually compute the canonical correlations for each pair of canonical variables.
        6. **Average Correlation Calculation**: Calculate the average of the canonical correlations.
        7. **CCA Score Calculation**: Use the `cca.score` method to calculate the average canonical correlation score.
        
        ### Consistency Check:
        
        - The manually calculated average canonical correlation should match the `cca.score`.
        - If there's still a discrepancy, double-check the input data and ensure no preprocessing steps were missed.
        
        ### Troubleshooting:
        
        If the `cca.score` still does not match the average of manually calculated correlations, check for potential issues such as:
        
        - Misalignment or indexing errors in the data subsets.
        - Ensure all data preprocessing steps are consistent between manual and method-based calculations.
        - Verify there are no NaNs or infinities in the data after transformations.
        
        By following these steps and ensuring correct preprocessing, the manually calculated average canonical correlation should match the `cca.score`.
        
    - i don't get why cca.score is done on embeddings before doing cca.transform?
        
        
        The `cca.score` method works directly on the embeddings (`embedding1` and `embedding2`) because it encapsulates both the transformation and the correlation computation in one step. Here’s the process:
        
    - high cca score, low corr coeffs
        
        The output suggests that there are issues with the canonical correlation analysis (CCA) results, indicated by the highly negative canonical correlation and the extremely low correlation coefficients. Here’s a breakdown of what these values mean and possible reasons for these results:
        
        ### Breakdown of the Results
        
        1. **Canonical Correlations: -0.9934121981814538**
            - This value indicates a very strong inverse relationship between the canonical variates of the transformed data sets.
            - In a typical CCA, such a strong negative correlation is unusual and might indicate an issue with the data preprocessing or the fitting process.
        2. **Correlation Coefficients: [0.0038447374325681206, 0.0021137853358469474]**
            - These values represent the correlation coefficients for the individual components of the transformed data sets.
            - The extremely low values (close to zero) suggest that there is almost no linear relationship between the corresponding canonical variates for these components.
        
        ### Interpretation and Possible Issues
        
        The combination of a highly negative canonical correlation and near-zero correlation coefficients indicates that something might have gone wrong during the CCA process. Here are some potential issues and interpretations:
        
        1. **Data Preprocessing**:
            - Ensure that the data is properly scaled and standardized before applying CCA. Inconsistent or incorrect scaling can lead to misleading results.
            - Double-check that the subsets or embeddings (e.g., `embedding1` and `embedding2`) are correctly derived and transformed.
        2. **Dimensionality Reduction Step**:
            - If UMAP or another dimensionality reduction technique was applied, verify that the parameters used are appropriate and that the resulting embeddings maintain meaningful relationships.
            - Non-linear transformations like UMAP can sometimes distort linear relationships, which can affect the CCA results.
        3. **Fit and Transform Steps**:
            - Ensure that the CCA model is correctly fitted to the data before scoring or transforming.
            - Double-check the order of operations and ensure consistency between fitting, transforming, and scoring.
        4. **Canonical Variates Interpretation**:
            - The strong negative correlation combined with low individual correlation coefficients might indicate overfitting or that the canonical variates are not capturing meaningful relationships.
        
        ### Suggestions for Troubleshooting
        
        To diagnose and address the issue, you might consider the following steps:
        
        1. **Verify Data Integrity**:
            - Check the integrity and preprocessing of the original data before applying CCA.
            - Ensure that there are no errors or anomalies in the data subsets used for CCA.
        2. **Review Dimensionality Reduction**:
            - Experiment with different parameters for UMAP or try alternative dimensionality reduction techniques (e.g., PCA) to see if the results improve.
        3. **Check CCA Implementation**:
            - Confirm that the CCA model is correctly fitted and transformed.
            - Ensure that the data passed to `cca.score` and `cca.transform` is consistent and correctly preprocessed.
        4. **Recalculate Step-by-Step**:
            - Manually calculate the canonical correlations step-by-step to identify where the discrepancy arises.
            - Compare the manual calculations with the results from the `cca.score` method.
        
        Here’s a revised and more detailed approach to fitting, transforming, and scoring the CCA model:
        
        ```python
        from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
        from sklearn.cross_decomposition import CCA
        import numpy as np
        
        # Assuming embedding1 and embedding2 are the UMAP-transformed embeddings
        
        # Step 1: Standardize the embeddings
        scaler = StandardScaler()
        embedding1 = scaler.fit_transform(embedding1)
        embedding2 = scaler.fit_transform(embedding2)
        
        # Step 2: Fit the CCA model
        cca = CCA(n_components=2)
        cca.fit(embedding1, embedding2)
        
        # Step 3: Transform the data
        A_c, B_c = cca.transform(embedding1, embedding2)
        
        # Step 4: Calculate canonical correlations manually
        canonical_correlations = [np.corrcoef(A_c[:, i], B_c[:, i])[0, 1] for i in range(A_c.shape[1])]
        print("Canonical Correlations (manual):", canonical_correlations)
        
        # Step 5: Compute the average canonical correlation score manually
        average_correlation_score = np.mean(canonical_correlations)
        print("Average Canonical Correlation Score (manual):", average_correlation_score)
        
        # Step 6: Compute the CCA score using the score method
        cca_score = cca.score(embedding1, embedding2)
        print("CCA Score:", cca_score)
        
        ```
        
        By following these steps and verifying each stage, you can identify potential issues and better understand the resulting canonical correlations.
        
    - is it valid to apply umap then cca; is it better to just apply cca on original data
        
        Applying UMAP followed by CCA can be valid depending on the specific goals and characteristics of your data. However, whether this approach is better than applying CCA directly on the original data depends on several factors. Let's discuss the considerations for both approaches.
        
        ### Applying UMAP Followed by CCA
        
        ### Advantages:
        
        1. **Dimensionality Reduction**:
            - UMAP is a powerful non-linear dimensionality reduction technique that can uncover complex structures in the data, potentially making it easier for CCA to find meaningful relationships in a lower-dimensional space.
        2. **Noise Reduction**:
            - By reducing the dimensionality, UMAP can help filter out noise and highlight the most significant features, which might improve the performance of subsequent analyses like CCA.
        3. **Visualization**:
            - UMAP provides a way to visualize high-dimensional data in 2D or 3D, which can help in understanding the underlying structure and relationships before applying CCA.
        
        ### Disadvantages:
        
        1. **Non-Linear Transformation**:
            - UMAP is a non-linear method, which means that the relationships between variables in the original high-dimensional space may not be preserved in the lower-dimensional space. This can affect the interpretability of the canonical correlations obtained from CCA.
        2. **Loss of Information**:
            - Dimensionality reduction techniques can sometimes lose important information, especially if the reduced dimensions are not sufficient to capture the complexity of the data.
        
        ### Applying CCA Directly on Original Data
        
        ### Advantages:
        
        1. **Linear Relationships**:
            - CCA is a linear method that identifies linear relationships between two datasets. Applying it directly to the original data ensures that these relationships are based on the full information present in the data.
        2. **Interpretability**:
            - The canonical variates obtained from CCA on the original data are easier to interpret in terms of the original variables.
        
        ### Disadvantages:
        
        1. **High Dimensionality**:
            - If the original data is high-dimensional, CCA might struggle due to the curse of dimensionality, where the large number of variables can lead to overfitting and poor generalization.
        2. **Noise**:
            - High-dimensional data often contains noise, which can obscure the meaningful relationships that CCA is trying to uncover.
        
        ### Recommendations
        
        1. **Exploratory Analysis**:
            - Use UMAP for exploratory data analysis and visualization to understand the structure of your data. This can help in identifying the most relevant features and understanding the relationships before applying CCA.
        2. **Apply CCA Directly**:
            - If interpretability and preserving linear relationships are crucial, consider applying CCA directly on the original data, especially if the dimensionality is manageable.
        3. **Hybrid Approach**:
            - Consider a hybrid approach where you first use UMAP to reduce dimensionality to a level that is still interpretable and then apply CCA. This can balance the benefits of noise reduction and visualization from UMAP with the interpretability of CCA.
        
        ### Example Code for Both Approaches
        
        ### 1. Applying CCA Directly on Original Data:
        
        ```python
        from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
        from sklearn.cross_decomposition import CCA
        
        # Assuming X and Y are your original input matrices
        scaler = StandardScaler()
        X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)
        Y_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(Y)
        
        cca = CCA(n_components=2)
        cca.fit(X_scaled, Y_scaled)
        
        A_c, B_c = cca.transform(X_scaled, Y_scaled)

        canonical_correlations = [np.corrcoef(A_c[:, i], B_c[:, i])[0, 1] for i in range(A_c.shape[1])]
        print("Canonical Correlations (direct CCA):", canonical_correlations)
        
        cca_score = cca.score(X_scaled, Y_scaled)
        print("CCA Score (direct CCA):", cca_score)
        
        ```
        
        ### 2. Applying UMAP Followed by CCA:
        
        ```python
        import umap
        from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
        from sklearn.cross_decomposition import CCA
        
        # Assuming X and Y are your original input matrices
        scaler = StandardScaler()
        X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)
        Y_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(Y)
        
        umap_model = umap.UMAP(n_components=2)
        X_umap = umap_model.fit_transform(X_scaled)
        Y_umap = umap_model.fit_transform(Y_scaled)
        
        cca = CCA(n_components=2)
        cca.fit(X_umap, Y_umap)
        
        A_c, B_c = cca.transform(X_umap, Y_umap)
        
        # Calculate canonical correlations
        canonical_correlations = [np.corrcoef(A_c[:, i], B_c[:, i])[0, 1] for i in range(A_c.shape[1])]
        print("Canonical Correlations (UMAP + CCA):", canonical_correlations)
        
        cca_score = cca.score(X_umap, Y_umap)
        print("CCA Score (UMAP + CCA):", cca_score)
        
        ```
        
        ### Conclusion
        
        Choosing between applying UMAP followed by CCA or applying CCA directly to the original data depends on your specific data characteristics and analysis goals. Both approaches have their merits and potential pitfalls, so it's often useful to experiment with both and compare the results to determine which method provides more meaningful and interpretable insights for your particular use case.
        
    - does using a100 speed up plotting or cca calc in colab
        
        Using an A100 GPU in Google Colab can significantly speed up certain computations, particularly those that involve large-scale matrix operations or parallelizable tasks. However, the specific impact on plotting and Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) depends on how these tasks are implemented and whether they are optimized to leverage GPU acceleration. Let's break this down:
        
        ### Speed Up Plotting
        
        1. **Plotting Libraries**:
            - Most common plotting libraries in Python, such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly, do not typically utilize GPU acceleration. These libraries are primarily CPU-bound and might not see a significant speed improvement with a GPU like the A100.
            - Tasks like rendering plots, updating figures, and managing graphical user interface (GUI) elements are generally handled by the CPU.
        
        ### Speed Up CCA Calculations
        
        1. **Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)**:
            - CCA involves linear algebra operations, which can be accelerated on a GPU. Libraries that leverage GPU acceleration for linear algebra, such as CuPy (a GPU-accelerated drop-in replacement for NumPy) or RAPIDS cuML, can significantly speed up these computations.
            - Scikit-learn, the library typically used for CCA in Python, does not natively support GPU acceleration for CCA. However, you can use GPU-accelerated libraries to perform similar analyses.
        
        ### Example of GPU-Accelerated Linear Algebra for CCA
        
        To use GPU-accelerated linear algebra operations for something similar to CCA, you can use CuPy along with RAPIDS cuML. Here's an example:
        
        ```python
        # Install RAPIDS if not already installed
        !pip install -q rapids-cuml
        
        import cupy as cp
        from cuml import CCA
        
        # Assuming X and Y are your original input matrices on GPU
        X_gpu = cp.asarray(X)
        Y_gpu = cp.asarray(Y)
        
        # Standardize the data
        X_gpu = (X_gpu - cp.mean(X_gpu, axis=0)) / cp.std(X_gpu, axis=0)
        Y_gpu = (Y_gpu - cp.mean(Y_gpu, axis=0)) / cp.std(Y_gpu, axis=0)
        
        # Perform CCA using RAPIDS cuML
        cca_gpu = CCA(n_components=2)
        cca_gpu.fit(X_gpu, Y_gpu)
        
        A_c_gpu, B_c_gpu = cca_gpu.transform(X_gpu, Y_gpu)
        
        # Transfer results back to CPU for further processing if needed
        A_c = cp.asnumpy(A_c_gpu)
        B_c = cp.asnumpy(B_c_gpu)
        
        # Calculate canonical correlations manually
        canonical_correlations = [np.corrcoef(A_c[:, i], B_c[:, i])[0, 1] for i in range(A_c.shape[1])]
        print("Canonical Correlations (GPU CCA):", canonical_correlations)
        
        ```
        
        ### Conclusion
        
        - **Plotting**: Using an A100 GPU will not significantly speed up plotting tasks in most common Python plotting libraries since they are CPU-bound.
        - **CCA Calculations**: The A100 GPU can speed up CCA calculations if you use GPU-accelerated libraries such as RAPIDS cuML. For CCA in scikit-learn, the computations will remain CPU-bound unless you switch to a library that leverages GPU acceleration.
        
        Therefore, to leverage the A100 GPU for CCA in Google Colab, consider using GPU-accelerated libraries designed for linear algebra and machine learning tasks.
        
    - due to umap randomness does that mean cca score on umap embeddings is diff each time
        
        Yes, the Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) score on UMAP embeddings can differ each time due to the inherent randomness in UMAP's algorithm. UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) uses stochastic processes, including random initializations and stochastic gradient descent, which can lead to slightly different embeddings on each run unless you set a fixed random seed.
        
        ### Understanding UMAP's Randomness
        
        1. **Stochastic Nature**:
            - UMAP relies on stochastic processes to construct the high-dimensional graph and then optimize the low-dimensional representation.
            - This can introduce variability in the resulting embeddings across different runs.
        2. **Random Initialization**:
            - The initial positions of points in the lower-dimensional space are randomly set, which can influence the final outcome.
        3. **Optimization**:
            - The optimization process in UMAP is non-deterministic, further contributing to the variability in embeddings.
        
        ### Impact on CCA
        
        When you apply CCA to the embeddings generated by UMAP, the variability in the embeddings can lead to different canonical correlations and, consequently, different CCA scores each time UMAP is run.
        
        ### Mitigating Variability
        
        To mitigate the variability and make the results reproducible, you can set a fixed random seed for UMAP. This ensures that the random processes within UMAP produce the same results each time.
        
        ### Setting a Random Seed in UMAP
        
        Here’s how you can set a random seed in UMAP to ensure reproducible embeddings:
        
        ```python
        import umap
        from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
        from sklearn.cross_decomposition import CCA
        import numpy as np
        
        # Assuming X and Y are your original input matrices
        scaler = StandardScaler()
        X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)
        Y_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(Y)
        
        # Set a fixed random seed for UMAP
        random_state = 42  # You can choose any integer
        
        umap_model = umap.UMAP(n_components=2, random_state=random_state)
        X_umap = umap_model.fit_transform(X_scaled)
        Y_umap = umap_model.fit_transform(Y_scaled)
        
        # Fit the CCA model
        cca = CCA(n_components=2)
        cca.fit(X_umap, Y_umap)
        
        # Transform the data
        A_c, B_c = cca.transform(X_umap, Y_umap)
        
        # Calculate canonical correlations manually
        canonical_correlations = [np.corrcoef(A_c[:, i], B_c[:, i])[0, 1] for i in range(A_c.shape[1])]
        print("Canonical Correlations (UMAP + CCA):", canonical_correlations)
        
        # Compute the CCA score
        cca_score = cca.score(X_umap, Y_umap)
        print("CCA Score (UMAP + CCA):", cca_score)
        
        ```
        
        ### Summary
        
        - **Variability**: UMAP's randomness can lead to different embeddings, affecting the CCA scores.
        - **Reproducibility**: Setting a fixed random seed in UMAP ensures reproducible embeddings and consistent CCA scores across runs.
        - **Implementation**: Use the `random_state` parameter in UMAP to control the randomness.
        
        By setting a random seed, you can ensure that the results of your UMAP and subsequent CCA analyses are reproducible and consistent each time you run the code.

        - coefficient of det vs mean of canon coeff
            
            The coefficient of determination (R²) and the mean of canonical correlation coefficients are two different metrics used to evaluate Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA). Here’s a detailed comparison and explanation of these metrics:
            
            ### Coefficient of Determination (R²)
            
            The coefficient of determination, or R², measures how well the canonical variates from one dataset can predict the canonical variates from the other dataset. This is akin to evaluating the goodness-of-fit of a regression model.
            
            - **Definition**: R² is the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable(s).
            - **Computation in CCA**: When using the `cca.score` method in scikit-learn, R² is calculated as the proportion of variance in the canonical variates of Y that can be explained by the canonical variates of X.
            - **Range**: R² ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 indicates no predictive power and 1 indicates perfect prediction.
            
            ### Mean of Canonical Correlation Coefficients
            
            Canonical correlation coefficients measure the linear relationships between pairs of canonical variates derived from the two datasets.
            
            - **Definition**: Canonical correlation coefficients are the Pearson correlation coefficients between the pairs of canonical variates.
            - **Computation in CCA**: After transforming the data using CCA, canonical correlations are calculated for each pair of canonical variates.
            - **Mean Canonical Correlation**: The mean of these coefficients gives an overall sense of the linear relationship strength between the datasets.
            
            ### Example Calculation of Both Metrics
            
            Here’s an example showing how to calculate both the coefficient of determination (R²) and the mean of canonical correlation coefficients using scikit-learn’s CCA:
            
            ```python
            from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
            from sklearn.cross_decomposition import CCA
            import numpy as np
            
            # Example data
            X = np.random.rand(100, 10)
            Y = np.random.rand(100, 10)
            
            # Standardize the data
            scaler = StandardScaler()
            X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)
            Y_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(Y)
            
            # Apply CCA
            cca = CCA(n_components=2)
            cca.fit(X_scaled, Y_scaled)
            
            # Transform the data
            X_c, Y_c = cca.transform(X_scaled, Y_scaled)
            
            # Calculate canonical correlations manually
            canonical_correlations = [np.corrcoef(X_c[:, i], Y_c[:, i])[0, 1] for i in range(X_c.shape[1])]
            print("Canonical Correlations:", canonical_correlations)
            
            # Compute the mean of canonical correlations
            mean_canonical_correlation = np.mean(canonical_correlations)
            print("Mean Canonical Correlation:", mean_canonical_correlation)
            
            # Compute the CCA score (coefficient of determination)
            cca_score = cca.score(X_scaled, Y_scaled)
            print("CCA Score (R²):", cca_score)
            
            ```
            
            ### Interpretation of Results
            
            1. **Canonical Correlations**:
                - Each value in `canonical_correlations` represents the strength of the linear relationship between a pair of canonical variates from `X` and `Y`.
                - The mean canonical correlation provides an average measure of these relationships.
            2. **CCA Score (R²)**:
                - The CCA score represents how well the canonical variates of `X` predict the canonical variates of `Y`.
                - This score is a measure of the overall predictive power of the canonical relationship.
            
            ### Choosing Between the Metrics
            
            - **Coefficient of Determination (R²)**:
                - Use this if you are interested in the predictive power of the canonical variates. It tells you how well one set of canonical variates predicts the other.
                - Useful for assessing the explanatory power of the model.
            - **Mean Canonical Correlation**:
                - Use this if you are more interested in the average strength of the linear relationships between the canonical variates.
                - Provides a direct measure of the correlation strength.
            
            Both metrics are valuable, but they serve different purposes. The choice between them depends on whether your primary interest lies in prediction (R²) or in measuring the strength of associations (mean canonical correlation).

    - [what's the diffeence between fit and transform](https://chatgpt.com/c/a0b74b21-ff52-481e-a5f0-ed437df3f437)
    - so you need fit before transform? can't use score before transform?
        
        Yes, you need to call `fit` before `transform` when using most machine learning models, including Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA). This is because `fit` is the step where the model learns the necessary parameters based on the input data. Without fitting the model first, the `transform` method wouldn't know how to process the input data.
        
        ### Sequence of Operations
        
        1. **Fit:**
            - `cca.fit(X1_sc, X2_sc)`
            - This step is mandatory. It computes the parameters needed for transformation, which in the case of CCA, are the weights for the linear combinations that maximize the correlation between the datasets.
        2. **Transform:**
            - `X1_c, X2_c = cca.transform(X1_sc, X2_sc)`
            - After fitting, this step applies the learned transformation to the input data, projecting it into the canonical variates space.
        
        ### Using `score` Method
        
        In many machine learning models, there is also a `score` method that evaluates the performance of the model. However, in the context of CCA, the `score` method might not be directly applicable or may not exist. If it does exist, it would typically require the model to be fit first.
        
        - **Score (if applicable):**
            - `cca.score(X1_sc, X2_sc)`
            - This method, if available, would evaluate the model's performance based on some criterion (e.g., correlation strength in the case of CCA). However, it assumes that the model has already been fitted.
        
        ### Summary
        
        - **Fit:** Mandatory initial step to learn the model parameters.
        - **Transform:** Requires the model to be fitted first. Applies the learned transformation to the data.
        - **Score:** If available, usually requires the model to be fitted and might evaluate the model's performance.
        
        In conclusion, you cannot use `transform` or `score` before `fit` because the model needs to learn the necessary parameters during the fitting process before it can transform the data or evaluate its performance.

        - try to load just actvs, reshape (del orig), and save corrs BEFORE load weights  + labels. Then load just weights, labels, acts, and corr in second run to get umap comparisons
            - NOTE: acts is used to calc dataset exmps, but takes up many gbs
            - we can rewrite the fns to use reshaped actvs instead! all we have to do is not do reshape(-1) to flatten it
        - ✅ ALT: instead of compute entire matrix, for each feature in B, get row of all corrs with every feature in A, then keep only top ind and delete this row. Save and repeat for all features in B. Or instead of “each feature”, do it for small batch of features.

    - ✅ ⚠️ get top highest corr pairs, and interpret
        - DEBUG: this is incorrect. highest_correlations_values shuld be the same len as highest_correlations_indices, and contains the value of the corr betwen index (B) and mapped index (A). Instead, it contains every batch value, not just the highest pair!

                    - does it matter if we initalize the reducer in two different instances but with same parameters?
                        
                        Yes, it does matter if you initialize the reducer in two different instances, even with the same parameters, because the UMAP algorithm involves stochastic processes such as initialization and optimization steps that can lead to different results. By using two different reducer instances, you can get slightly different embeddings even if the parameters are the same.
                        
                        Here's a more detailed explanation:
                        
                        ### Stochastic Nature of UMAP
                        
                        UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) involves stochastic optimization, meaning that random initialization and random choices during optimization can lead to different embeddings each time you run it. Parameters such as the number of neighbors (`n_neighbors`), minimum distance (`min_dist`), and the metric (`metric`) set the structure of the UMAP algorithm, but the random seed affects the initialization and convergence of the algorithm.
                        
                        ### Consistent Embeddings
                        
                        If you want consistent embeddings across different datasets:
                        
                        - **Use the same reducer instance**: Fit the reducer on a combined dataset and then transform each dataset.
                        - **Set a random seed**: Initialize the reducer with a fixed random seed to ensure reproducibility.
                        
                        Here is an example:
                        
                        ```python
                        import umap
                        import numpy as np
                        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
                        
                        # Example datasets
                        data1 = np.random.rand(100, 10)
                        data2 = np.random.rand(100, 10)
                        data3 = np.random.rand(100, 10)
                        
                        # Combine datasets
                        combined_data = np.vstack((data1, data2, data3))
                        
                        # Create and fit UMAP reducer on combined dataset with a fixed random seed
                        reducer = umap.UMAP(n_neighbors=15, min_dist=0.01, metric='euclidean', random_state=42)
                        reducer.fit(combined_data)
                        
                        # Transform each dataset using the same reducer
                        embedding1 = reducer.transform(data1)
                        embedding2 = reducer.transform(data2)
                        embedding3 = reducer.transform(data3)
                        
                        # Plot the embeddings
                        plt.figure(figsize=(12, 4))
                        
                        plt.subplot(1, 3, 1)
                        plt.scatter(embedding1[:, 0], embedding1[:, 1], label='Dataset 1')
                        plt.title('Dataset 1')
                        plt.legend()

                        plt.title('Dataset 2')
                        plt.legend()
                        
                        plt.subplot(1, 3, 3)
                        plt.scatter(embedding3[:, 0], embedding3[:, 1], label='Dataset 3')

                        plt.tight_layout()
                        plt.show()
                        
                        ```
                        
                        ### Using Two Different Reducer Instances
                        
                        If you use two different reducer instances with the same parameters but without fixing the random seed, the embeddings might look similar but will not be identical:
                        
                        ```python
                        # Create two separate UMAP reducers with the same parameters
                        reducer1 = umap.UMAP(n_neighbors=15, min_dist=0.01, metric='euclidean')
                        reducer2 = umap.UMAP(n_neighbors=15, min_dist=0.01, metric='euclidean')
                        
                        # Fit and transform each dataset separately
                        embedding1 = reducer1.fit_transform(data1)
                        embedding2 = reducer2.fit_transform(data2)
                        
                        # These embeddings are not guaranteed to be in the same space
                        
                        # Plot the embeddings
                        plt.figure(figsize=(8, 4))
                        
                        plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
                        plt.scatter(embedding1[:, 0], embedding1[:, 1], label='Dataset 1')
                        plt.title('Dataset 1')
                        plt.legend()
                        
                        plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)
                        plt.scatter(embedding2[:, 0], embedding2[:, 1], label='Dataset 2')
                        plt.title('Dataset 2')
                        plt.legend()
                        
                        plt.tight_layout()
                        plt.show()
                        
                        ```
                        
                        In summary, for comparable and consistent embeddings across different datasets, it is crucial to use the same reducer instance and ideally set a random seed for reproducibility.

- ✅ in umap python, difference between reducer.transform and reducer.fit
    
    In UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection), `reducer.fit` and `reducer.transform` serve different purposes and are used at different stages of the dimensionality reduction process.
    
    ### `reducer.fit`
    
    - **Purpose**: This method is used to learn the embedding from the training data. It performs the dimensionality reduction by fitting the UMAP model to the data.
    - **Usage**: Use `reducer.fit` when you want to train the UMAP model on a given dataset.
    - **Functionality**: It computes the low-dimensional embedding for the training data. After fitting, the UMAP model captures the structure of the data in the lower-dimensional space.
    - **Code Example**:
        
        ```python
        import umap
        
        # Create UMAP object
        reducer = umap.UMAP(n_neighbors=15, min_dist=0.1, n_components=2)
        
        # Fit the model to the data
        reducer.fit(X_train)
        
        ```
        
    
    ### `reducer.transform`
    
    - **Purpose**: This method is used to map new data points into the existing low-dimensional space learned by `reducer.fit`.
    - **Usage**: Use `reducer.transform` when you have already fitted the UMAP model on the training data and now want to transform new data points into the same lower-dimensional space.
    - **Functionality**: It takes the fitted UMAP model and projects new data points onto the pre-learned embedding space without altering the learned structure.
    - **Code Example**:
        
        ```python
        # Assuming the UMAP model has already been fitted
        X_new_transformed = reducer.transform(X_new)
        
        ```
        
    
    ### Example Workflow
    
    1. **Fit the model on the training data**:
        
        ```python
        import umap
        
        # Create UMAP object
        reducer = umap.UMAP(n_neighbors=15, min_dist=0.1, n_components=2)
        
        # Fit the model to the training data
        reducer.fit(X_train)
        
        ```
        
    2. **Transform new data points using the fitted model**:
        
        ```python
        # Transform new data points
        X_new_transformed = reducer.transform(X_new)
        
        ```
        
    
    ### Key Points
    
    - **`reducer.fit`** is for learning the embedding from the training data.
    - **`reducer.transform`** is for projecting new data into the learned embedding space.
    - Use `fit` when you want to create the model, and `transform` when you want to apply the model to new data.
    
    By separating these steps, UMAP allows for efficient use of the learned embedding, enabling you to apply the same transformation to multiple datasets once the model has been trained.
    
- ✅ ask neuronpedia if they have feature splitting umaps
    
    1) I was wondering if Neuronpedia has ways for users to plot the combined set of feature directions from SAEs of different widths (such as the set of GPT-2 feature splitting SAEs), as seen in the attached plot from “Scaling Monosemanticity”? If not, I saw in the last update that UMAPs for all SAEs are being generated and also wondering if this might be a future update.
    
    2) I’ve been plotting UMAPs of combined feature directions from SAEs of different widths trained on tinystories models by first learning the embedding on all the feature directions (decoder weights stacked row-wise), then transforming each SAE’s weights into the new lower-dim space (coloured by SAE dict width). Would this be the right way to reproduce Anthropic’s plots?
    
    3) If the feature splitting UMAPs aren’t present for now, I was looking to put the pre-trained GPT-2 SM L8 decoder weights and the exportable explanations into an interactive UMAP plot. While I find many highly correlated features and clusters in the tinystories SAEs, the feature splitting is not as prominent; it may be due to how I train the SAEs, so I might find better results with the pretrained SAEs.  If anyone else is exploring this, such as with training better SAEs on tinystories GPT-2 models, I would be interested in talking more about it (eg. by DM)!

        - Umap links / tables on individual SAEs for feature splitting [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lD1u1mUn7mogxbfqSGw9VK4mSRu6cxnu](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lD1u1mUn7mogxbfqSGw9VK4mSRu6cxnu). We're very busy getting some big SAE releases ready but maybe this will help between now and then.
        - You can load in these SAEs via SAELens and make joint u-maps yourself if you'd like to. We haven't thought about joint u-maps yet as there's some complexity here...
        - You can download and merge feature explanations from autointerp via a button in the top right of SAE pages [https://www.neuronpedia.org/gpt2-small/8-res_fs768-jb](https://www.neuronpedia.org/gpt2-small/8-res_fs768-jb) or via the API (see Neuronpedia API docs). [https://www.neuronpedia.org/api-doc](https://www.neuronpedia.org/api-doc)
        - Towards Monosemanticity contains methods for constructing u-maps and identifying clusters in them. We've found this requires hyperparameter tuning. I'm not sure what changes for joint SAE u-maps but my guess is not much. I've made a note to include umap generating code in updated SAE Lens tutorial (coming soon!)

        Thanks! The umaps and feature labels are very helpful! I've been using saelens to make the joint umaps, though still working on improving them. The umap tutorial should be very helpful once it's released! (one thing I noticed was umap-learn and saelens didn't seem to be compatible in the same colab notebook, think it was something to do with numpy vers, so when I started out I just crudely saved sae activations/labels/weights and loaded them locally or in another nb to run umap)

    - ✅ using !pip was not the issue, as it also works
        - difference of using %pip vs !pip in colab
            
            In Google Colab, both `%pip` and `!pip` can be used to install Python packages, but there are some key differences between them. Here's a breakdown:
            
            1. **Syntax and Context**:
                - `%pip`: This is a magic command specific to IPython (and by extension, Jupyter notebooks and Colab). It runs within the IPython environment.
                - `!pip`: This is a shell command that runs in a subshell outside the IPython environment. It invokes the system's shell to execute the `pip` command.
            2. **Environment Awareness**:
                - `%pip`: Since it is aware of the IPython environment, it ensures that packages are installed in the correct Python environment associated with the notebook kernel. This helps avoid issues where the notebook kernel and the shell environment might be different.
                - `!pip`: This runs in the shell, which may not be the same environment as the notebook's kernel. This can sometimes lead to discrepancies where a package seems to install successfully but is not available in the notebook.
            3. **Integration with Notebook**:
                - `%pip`: Automatically updates the Python interpreter of the notebook without requiring a restart. It integrates more smoothly with the notebook.
                - `!pip`: May require restarting the kernel to reflect the changes made by installing or updating packages.
            4. **Best Practice**:
                - It is generally recommended to use `%pip` in Jupyter notebooks and Colab because it ensures that the installed packages are available in the notebook's Python environment immediately.
            
            ### Example Usage:
            
            - Using `%pip`:
                
                ```python
                %pip install numpy
                
                ```
                
            - Using `!pip`:
                
                ```python
                !pip install numpy
                
                ```
                
            
            ### Summary:
            
            - **Use `%pip`** for a more reliable and integrated package installation in Colab notebooks.
            - **Use `!pip`** if you need to run shell commands or for scripts that are executed outside of the IPython environment.
            
            Using `%pip` reduces the chances of running into issues related to mismatched environments, making it the preferred choice for package management within Colab.

            To get custom labels in the interactive HTML visualization generated by `kmapper`, you can use the `custom_tooltips` argument in the `mapper.visualize` function. This allows you to display additional information about each data point when hovering over it in the visualization. Here's an explanation of each argument used in the `mapper.visualize` function:
            
            1. **graph**:
                - This is the graph object created by the `KeplerMapper` object. It represents the Mapper output, including nodes and edges.
            2. **path_html**:
                - This argument specifies the file path where the HTML file will be saved. In this case, `fileID + ".html"` means the HTML file will be named based on the value of `fileID` with the ".html" extension.
            3. **title**:
                - The title of the HTML visualization. Here, it's set to `fileID`, meaning the title of the visualization will be the same as the value of `fileID`.
            4. **custom_tooltips**:
                - This argument is used to provide custom labels or tooltips for the data points. In this case, `df_close.columns.to_numpy()` suggests that the column names of the dataframe `df_close` are being used as the custom tooltips. This will display these column names when hovering over nodes in the visualization.
            5. **color_values**:
                - This argument is used to specify the values that will determine the color of the nodes. Here, `np.log(per_return+1)` is used, indicating that the logarithm of `per_return` values (plus 1 to avoid taking log of zero) will be used to color the nodes.
            6. **color_function_name**:
                - The name of the color function used in the legend of the visualization. In this case, it's set to 'Log Percent Returns', which will be displayed as the legend title for the color values.
            7. **node_color_function**:
                - This argument specifies how the colors should be aggregated for each node. It accepts an array of functions like `['average', 'std', 'sum', 'max', 'min']`, which determines how the color values for the points within each node are combined. This means each node's color can represent the average, standard deviation, sum, maximum, or minimum of the color values of the points within that node.
            
            Here's how you might call the `mapper.visualize` function with these arguments:
            
            ```python
            import kmapper as km
            import numpy as np
            
            # Assuming graph, fileID, df_close, and per_return are already defined
            mapper = km.KeplerMapper()
            
            # Create the visualization
            mapper.visualize(
                graph,
                path_html=f"{fileID}.html",
                title=fileID,
                custom_tooltips=df_close.columns.to_numpy(),
                color_values=np.log(per_return + 1),
                color_function_name='Log Percent Returns',
                node_color_function=np.array(['average', 'std', 'sum', 'max', 'min'])
            )
            
            ```
            
            This will generate an interactive HTML file where each node can display custom tooltips based on the column names of `df_close`, and the nodes will be colored based on the logarithm of the percent returns.
            
        - how does custom_tooltip work? each node is a cluster, so how does the structure of custom_tooltip  determine what labels are in each cluster? does each cluster contain data points (rows) from original data put into mapper?
            
            The `custom_tooltips` argument in `kmapper`'s `visualize` function is used to provide additional information about each data point within the clusters (nodes) when you hover over them in the interactive HTML visualization. Understanding how this works requires knowledge of how `kmapper` clusters data and how the `custom_tooltips` argument interfaces with these clusters.
            
            ### Understanding Custom Tooltips
            
            1. **Nodes and Clusters**:
                - In `kmapper`, each node in the visualization represents a cluster of data points from the original dataset.
                - The Mapper algorithm projects the data into a lower-dimensional space, applies a covering (e.g., overlapping intervals), and clusters the data within each interval. These clusters become the nodes in the graph.
            2. **Data Points in Nodes**:
                - Each node contains indices of the original data points that fall into that cluster.
                - When hovering over a node in the visualization, you can see the tooltips for all the data points in that cluster.
            3. **Structure of `custom_tooltips`**:
                - `custom_tooltips` should be an array-like structure where each element corresponds to a data point in the original dataset.
                - This array provides the information to display when hovering over nodes. Each entry in `custom_tooltips` can be a string or a more complex object like a list or dictionary, depending on what information you want to show.
            
            ### Example Explanation
            
            Let's say you have a dataset with 100 data points and each data point has a label you want to display. Your `custom_tooltips` array should have 100 elements, each corresponding to a data point in the dataset.
            
            ### Example
            
            Here's an example to illustrate this:
            
            ```python
            import kmapper as km
            import numpy as np
            import pandas as pd
            
            # Example data
            data = np.random.rand(100, 5)  # 100 data points, 5 features each
            labels = np.array(['Point {}'.format(i) for i in range(100)])  # Create custom labels for each data point
            
            # Create a KeplerMapper object
            mapper = km.KeplerMapper()
            
            # Fit and transform the data to create a graph
            projected_data = mapper.fit_transform(data, projection='sum')  # Simple projection for example
            graph = mapper.map(projected_data, clusterer=km.cluster.DBSCAN(eps=0.5, min_samples=3))
            
            # Visualize with custom tooltips
            mapper.visualize(
                graph,
                path_html="example.html",
                title="Example Visualization",
                custom_tooltips=labels,
                color_values=projected_data[:, 0],  # Just an example for color values
                color_function_name='Sum Projection',
                node_color_function=np.array(['average'])
            )
            
            ```
            
            ### How `custom_tooltips` Works
            
            1. **Create Custom Tooltips**:
                - Here, `labels` is an array where each element is a string label corresponding to a data point in `data`.
            2. **Using Custom Tooltips in Visualization**:
                - When `mapper.visualize` is called, it uses the `custom_tooltips` array to provide the tooltips for the nodes.
                - For each node, `kmapper` looks at the indices of the original data points that belong to that node (cluster).
                - It then displays the corresponding elements from `custom_tooltips` for those data points.
            
            ### Displaying Custom Tooltips
            
            When you hover over a node in the HTML visualization, you'll see the tooltips corresponding to all the data points in that node. Each tooltip is taken from the `custom_tooltips` array based on the indices of the data points in the node.
            
            To summarize, the `custom_tooltips` array should have a length equal to the number of data points in your original dataset, with each element providing the desired tooltip information for the corresponding data point. When visualizing, `kmapper` uses these tooltips to show additional information about the data points within each cluster (node) in the interactive HTML visualization.

    - is umap a filter function or something else in mapper? what about isomap?
        
        UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) and Isomap (Isometric Mapping) are both dimensionality reduction techniques, but they are not filter functions in the context of the Mapper algorithm. Here's a detailed explanation of each:
        
        ### UMAP
        
        UMAP is a dimensionality reduction technique that is used to project high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional space (usually 2D or 3D) while preserving as much of the structure of the data as possible. It is not a filter function but rather a standalone technique used for visualizing and understanding high-dimensional data. UMAP works by constructing a high-dimensional graph representation of the data and then optimizing a low-dimensional representation of this graph to maintain the structure.
        
        ### Isomap
        
        Isomap is another dimensionality reduction technique that seeks to preserve the geodesic distances between data points in the high-dimensional space when projecting them to a lower-dimensional space. Like UMAP, Isomap is not a filter function but a technique for embedding high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional space. Isomap constructs a graph based on the nearest neighbors of the data points and then computes the shortest paths in this graph to approximate the geodesic distances.
        
        ### Mapper Algorithm
        
        The Mapper algorithm is a method used in topological data analysis (TDA) to capture the shape of high-dimensional data. It consists of the following main steps:
        
        1. **Filter Function**: A filter function is applied to the data. This function can be any scalar function that assigns a value to each data point. Common choices include distance functions, density estimators, or other functions capturing interesting aspects of the data.
        2. **Covering**: The range of the filter function is covered with overlapping intervals or bins.
        3. **Clustering**: The data points within each interval are clustered, typically using techniques like k-means or DBSCAN.
        4. **Simplicial Complex Construction**: The clusters are used to construct a simplicial complex, where nodes represent clusters and edges represent non-empty intersections between clusters.
        
        While UMAP and Isomap can be used to preprocess data or as part of the analysis pipeline in TDA, they are not specific to the Mapper algorithm and do not function as filter functions within it. Filter functions in the Mapper algorithm are generally simple scalar functions applied directly to the data points, rather than complex dimensionality reduction techniques.
        
    - if mapper just obtains a graph, how can that be a simp complex that approx a manifold?
        
        The Mapper algorithm produces a graph (or more generally, a simplicial complex) that serves as an approximation of the underlying topological space (or manifold) of the high-dimensional data. Here's a detailed explanation of how this process works:
        
        ### Steps in the Mapper Algorithm
        
        1. **Filter Function Application**: A filter function \( f \) is applied to the high-dimensional data \( X \). This function assigns a scalar value to each data point. Common examples of filter functions include projections onto the first principal component, distance from a point, or density estimators.
        2. **Covering of Filter Function Range**: The range of the filter function \( f(X) \) is divided into overlapping intervals or bins. This overlapping ensures that nearby points in the filter function's range are also considered close in the covering intervals.
        3. **Clustering Within Intervals**: For each interval \( I \) in the covering, the data points whose filter function values lie within \( I \) are selected. These selected points are then clustered using a clustering algorithm such as k-means or DBSCAN. This step effectively groups points that are close in the original high-dimensional space and have similar filter function values.
        4. **Construction of Nodes and Edges**: Each cluster within an interval is represented as a node in the Mapper graph. If clusters from overlapping intervals share common points (i.e., if the intersection of clusters is non-empty), an edge is drawn between the corresponding nodes.
        
        ### Simplicial Complex and Approximation of a Manifold
        
        - **Graph to Simplicial Complex**: While the immediate output of the Mapper algorithm is a graph, this graph can be interpreted as a 1-dimensional simplicial complex (where nodes are 0-simplices and edges are 1-simplices). To build higher-dimensional simplices, one could use the intersections of more clusters from multiple intervals, though this is less common in standard Mapper implementations.
        - **Manifold Approximation**: The Mapper algorithm approximates the manifold by capturing its topological features through the connectivity of the graph. The underlying idea is that the data, although high-dimensional, lies on or near a lower-dimensional manifold. By using the filter function and clustering in overlapping intervals, Mapper captures the structure and connectivity of this manifold.
        
        ### Visualization and Interpretation
        
        - **Topological Features**: The resulting graph from Mapper can reveal topological features such as clusters, loops, and voids, which correspond to 0-dimensional, 1-dimensional, and higher-dimensional holes in the data, respectively. These features are significant in understanding the shape and structure of the underlying manifold.
        - **Insight into Data**: By examining the Mapper graph, one can gain insights into the data's intrinsic geometry and topology. For example, the presence of loops might indicate circular structures, while disconnected components can suggest distinct clusters or regions in the data.
        
        ### Example
        
        Consider a 3D point cloud sampled from a torus. By applying Mapper with an appropriate filter function (e.g., one coordinate projection or distance from a central point), overlapping intervals, and clustering, the resulting graph can reveal the toroidal structure. Clusters corresponding to points on the torus will be connected in a way that reflects the torus's shape, even though the graph itself is a lower-dimensional representation.
        
        In summary, the Mapper algorithm's graph is a simplicial complex that approximates the manifold by capturing its topological structure through the connectivity of clusters. This approach allows for a meaningful reduction of high-dimensional data into a comprehensible topological summary.
        
    - how are higher dim simp complexes that better approx a manifold obtained then? persistent homology? other methods?
        
        Higher-dimensional simplicial complexes that better approximate a manifold can be obtained using various techniques. These techniques build on the idea of capturing the manifold's structure by considering not just pairwise relationships (as in a graph) but also higher-order relationships among data points. Here are some key methods:
        
        ### 1. **Vietoris-Rips Complex**
        
        The Vietoris-Rips complex is a standard method in topological data analysis (TDA) for constructing higher-dimensional simplicial complexes from data:
        
        - **Construction**: Given a set of points and a distance threshold \( \epsilon \), the Vietoris-Rips complex includes a k-simplex for every subset of \( k+1 \) points that are pairwise within distance \( \epsilon \) of each other.
        - **Higher-Dimensional Simplices**: This method naturally incorporates higher-dimensional simplices (triangles, tetrahedra, etc.) based on the proximity of data points.
        
        ### 2. **Cech Complex**
        
        The Cech complex is another method that uses geometric properties to form simplicial complexes:
        
        - **Construction**: For a given set of points and a radius \( r \), the Cech complex includes a k-simplex if the \( k+1 \) points have a common intersection in their \( r \)-radius balls.
        - **Geometric Insight**: The Cech complex provides a close approximation of the underlying manifold when the radius \( r \) is chosen appropriately.
        
        ### 3. **Alpha Complex**
        
        The Alpha complex is a subcomplex of the Delaunay triangulation and is closely related to the Cech complex:
        
        - **Construction**: Given a set of points and a parameter \( \alpha \), the Alpha complex includes simplices that correspond to Delaunay simplices with circumradius less than \( \alpha \).
        - **Manifold Approximation**: The Alpha complex is often a sparser representation than the Vietoris-Rips or Cech complexes, making it computationally efficient while still capturing the topological features of the data.
        
        ### 4. **Witness Complex**
        
        The Witness complex is a data-sparse representation that uses a set of landmark points to build the simplicial complex:
        
        - **Landmark Points**: A subset of data points (landmarks) is chosen to represent the data.
        - **Construction**: The simplicial complex is built based on the distances between landmarks and the remaining points, considering a witness condition.
        - **Efficiency**: This method is efficient for large datasets because it reduces the number of points involved in the complex construction.
        
        ### 5. **Mapper Algorithm with Higher-Dimensional Simplices**
        
        Although the standard Mapper algorithm primarily produces a 1-dimensional simplicial complex (graph), extensions can incorporate higher-dimensional simplices:
        
        - **Overlap and Intersection**: By considering more complex overlaps and intersections among clusters, higher-dimensional simplices can be formed. For example, if three clusters share common points, a 2-simplex (triangle) can be formed.
        - **Clustering**: Using advanced clustering techniques that capture higher-order relationships can help build a more comprehensive simplicial complex.
        
        ### 6. **Persistent Homology**
        
        Persistent homology is a method used to study the multi-scale topological features of data:
        
        - **Filtration**: A nested sequence of simplicial complexes (filtration) is constructed, typically using methods like Vietoris-Rips, Cech, or Alpha complexes with varying parameters.
        - **Persistence**: Persistent homology tracks the birth and death of topological features (connected components, loops, voids) across the filtration.
        - **Stability**: This method provides robust insights into the topological structure and is useful for identifying significant features that persist over multiple scales.
        
        ### Summary
        
        Higher-dimensional simplicial complexes provide a more accurate approximation of a manifold by capturing multi-point interactions and topological features beyond simple pairwise relationships. Methods like Vietoris-Rips, Cech, Alpha, Witness complexes, and extensions of the Mapper algorithm can be used to construct these complexes. Persistent homology is a powerful tool for analyzing the topological features of these complexes across different scales, offering a comprehensive understanding of the underlying manifold.
        
    - so persistent homology doesn't obtain the simp comp, just analyzes their invariant features? computationally/algorithmically how do we get Vietoris-Rips, Cech, Alpha, Witness complexes? doesn't seem like mapper can capture the higher dim properties, only 1D
        
        You're correct that persistent homology is used to analyze the invariant features of simplicial complexes over different scales, rather than to construct the complexes themselves. Below, I'll describe how to computationally and algorithmically obtain various types of simplicial complexes, including Vietoris-Rips, Cech, Alpha, and Witness complexes.
        
        ### Vietoris-Rips Complex
        
        The Vietoris-Rips complex construction is relatively straightforward:
        
        1. **Input**: A set of points \( X \) in a metric space and a distance threshold \( \epsilon \).
        2. **Pairwise Distances**: Compute the pairwise distances between all points in \( X \).
        3. **Simplex Construction**: For each subset of \( k+1 \) points, add a k-simplex to the complex if the pairwise distances between all points in the subset are less than \( \epsilon \).
        
        Algorithmically, this involves:
        
        - Creating a distance matrix for the points.
        - Iterating over all subsets of points to check the pairwise distances.
        - Adding the corresponding simplices to the complex if the condition is satisfied.
        
        ### Cech Complex
        
        The Cech complex requires checking for common intersections of balls centered at data points:
        
        1. **Input**: A set of points \( X \) and a radius \( r \).
        2. **Geometric Intersection**: For each subset of \( k+1 \) points, add a k-simplex to the complex if the \( r \)-balls centered at these points have a non-empty common intersection.
        
        Computationally:
        
        - This involves geometric calculations to check for ball intersections.
        - Typically, this is done using computational geometry libraries or packages.
        
        ### Alpha Complex
        
        The Alpha complex is constructed based on the Delaunay triangulation:
        
        1. **Input**: A set of points \( X \) and a parameter \( \alpha \).
        2. **Delaunay Triangulation**: Compute the Delaunay triangulation of the points.
        3. **Circumradius Condition**: Include simplices from the Delaunay triangulation whose circumradius is less than \( \alpha \).
        
        This involves:
        
        - Computing the Delaunay triangulation using algorithms like Quickhull.
        - Filtering simplices based on the circumradius condition.
        
        ### Witness Complex
        
        The Witness complex uses a subset of landmarks to represent the data:
        
        1. **Input**: A set of points \( X \), a subset of landmarks \( L \subset X \), and a parameter \( \epsilon \).
        2. **Witness Condition**: For each k-simplex formed by landmarks, check if there are points in \( X \) (witnesses) that are within distance \( \epsilon \) to all vertices of the simplex.
        
        Algorithmically:
        
        - Select landmarks (randomly or using a heuristic like k-means centroids).
        - Check the witness condition for all possible simplices formed by landmarks.
        
        ### Software and Libraries
        
        Several libraries and software packages can construct these complexes and compute persistent homology:
        
        - **GUDHI (Geometry Understanding in Higher Dimensions)**: A comprehensive library for TDA that supports the construction of Vietoris-Rips, Alpha complexes, and more.
        - **Ripser**: Specialized for computing Vietoris-Rips complexes and persistent homology.
        - **Dionysus**: A library for computing persistent homology and working with various simplicial complexes.
        
        ### Mapper Algorithm
        
        As you've noted, the standard Mapper algorithm primarily captures 1-dimensional topological features. However, it can be extended to capture higher-dimensional properties by considering more complex overlaps and using higher-dimensional clustering techniques. These extensions are not as common and can be more challenging to implement.
        
        ### Summary
        
        Persistent homology analyzes the invariant features of simplicial complexes, while the complexes themselves are constructed using methods like Vietoris-Rips, Cech, Alpha, and Witness complexes. Each of these methods has specific computational algorithms and existing libraries to facilitate their construction. Mapper typically captures 1-dimensional structures, but higher-dimensional simplicial complexes can be obtained through the methods described above for a more detailed approximation of the underlying manifold.

        - Does a simplicial complex always approx a manifold
            
            A simplicial complex does not always approximate a manifold, but under certain conditions, it can approximate a manifold closely. To understand this better, let's look at the definitions and key conditions involved:
            
            1. **Simplicial Complex**: A simplicial complex is a set made up of points, line segments, triangles, and their higher-dimensional counterparts (simplices) that are glued together in a specific way. It must satisfy the conditions that every face of a simplex in the complex is also a simplex in the complex and the intersection of any two simplices in the complex is a face of each of them.
            2. **Manifold**: A manifold is a topological space that locally resembles Euclidean space. More formally, an \(n\)-dimensional manifold is a space where each point has a neighborhood that is homeomorphic to an open subset of \(\mathbb{R}^n\).
            
            ### Approximation Conditions
            
            For a simplicial complex to approximate a manifold, certain conditions must be met:
            
            - **Dimension Matching**: The simplicial complex must have the same dimension as the manifold it approximates. For example, a 2-dimensional manifold would require a 2-dimensional simplicial complex for proper approximation.
            - **Piecewise Linearity**: The manifold should be piecewise linear (PL-manifold). A PL-manifold is a manifold with an atlas such that all transition maps are piecewise linear. In such cases, the manifold can be triangulated, meaning it can be represented as a simplicial complex.
            - **Local Homeomorphism**: Each simplex must be locally homeomorphic to a Euclidean space of the same dimension. This ensures that the local structure of the simplicial complex mimics that of the manifold.
            
            ### Simplicial Approximation Theorem
            
            The simplicial approximation theorem states that any continuous map from a simplicial complex to a topological space can be approximated by a simplicial map, provided certain conditions are satisfied. This theorem is often used to approximate continuous maps between topological spaces by simpler combinatorial objects.
            
            ### Triangulation of Manifolds
            
            One of the key results related to this topic is the existence of a triangulation for manifolds. This result states that every manifold can be triangulated, meaning it can be represented as a simplicial complex. However, this result is more complicated in higher dimensions:
            
            - For dimensions \( \leq 3 \), every manifold can be triangulated in a way that every triangulation is PL-equivalent.
            - For dimension \( 4 \), not every 4-manifold can be triangulated.
            - For dimensions \( > 4 \), the situation is even more complex, and there are manifolds that cannot be triangulated.
            
            ### Practical Considerations
            
            In practical applications, such as numerical simulations and computer graphics, simplicial complexes (often in the form of meshes) are used to approximate manifolds. These approximations work well in practice when the simplicial complex is sufficiently fine (i.e., has a large number of small simplices), ensuring that the local geometry closely matches that of the manifold.
            
            ### Conclusion
            
            While simplicial complexes can often approximate manifolds, this is not always guaranteed without meeting specific conditions such as dimension matching and local homeomorphism. The approximation is highly dependent on the properties of the manifold and the simplicial complex in question.
            
        - does the mapper algo create a s c that approx a manifold well
            
            The Mapper algorithm is a tool from topological data analysis (TDA) that creates a simplicial complex from a data set. Its goal is to provide a simplified representation of the underlying topological structure of the data. Whether this simplicial complex approximates a manifold well depends on several factors.
            
            ### Mapper Algorithm Overview
            
            The Mapper algorithm works as follows:
            
            1. **Filter Function**: Choose a filter function (or lens) that maps data points to a lower-dimensional space. This function is typically chosen to reveal some structure in the data.
            2. **Covering**: Cover the range of the filter function with overlapping intervals or regions.
            3. **Clustering**: Within each region, cluster the data points that fall into that region.
            4. **Nerve Construction**: Construct a simplicial complex called the nerve of the cover. Each cluster forms a node, and nodes are connected if their corresponding clusters have non-empty intersections.
            
            ### Factors Influencing the Quality of Approximation
            
            The ability of the Mapper algorithm to approximate a manifold well depends on several factors:
            
            1. **Choice of Filter Function**: The filter function significantly affects the resulting simplicial complex. A well-chosen filter function that captures the essential features of the data is crucial for creating a meaningful approximation.
            2. **Covering and Overlap**: The way the range of the filter function is covered by intervals or regions and the amount of overlap between them also influence the quality of the approximation. Too few intervals may lead to a loss of detail, while too many may result in noise.
            3. **Clustering Method**: The clustering algorithm used within each interval affects the resulting nodes of the simplicial complex. The clusters should reflect the true local structure of the data.
            4. **Density and Distribution of Data Points**: The density and distribution of the data points influence how well the Mapper complex can capture the manifold's structure. If the data points densely and uniformly sample the manifold, the approximation will be better.
            
            ### Mapper and Manifold Approximation
            
            When the conditions are right (appropriate filter function, sufficient and well-chosen intervals, effective clustering), the Mapper algorithm can create a simplicial complex that provides a useful approximation to the manifold structure of the data. However, it does not always guarantee a good approximation due to:
            
            - **Dimensionality**: The Mapper algorithm reduces dimensionality through the filter function, which can lead to loss of information.
            - **Resolution**: The granularity of the intervals and clustering impacts the resolution of the approximation.
            - **Noise Sensitivity**: The algorithm can be sensitive to noise in the data, which can distort the resulting simplicial complex.
            
            ### Practical Use
            
            In practice, the Mapper algorithm is a powerful tool for visualizing and understanding the shape of complex data sets, especially when the underlying structure is not well understood. It is particularly useful in exploratory data analysis, where capturing the general topological features is more important than precise manifold approximation.
            
            ### Conclusion
            
            The Mapper algorithm can create a simplicial complex that approximates a manifold well under certain conditions. The quality of the approximation depends on the choice of filter function, covering strategy, clustering method, and the characteristics of the data set. While not always perfect, Mapper is a valuable tool in topological data analysis for revealing the topological structure of data.
            
- ✅ analyze new Mapper plot
    - looks like a constellation
    - “upon” is still isolated as a cluster
    - many of the nodes with many connections in “subgraph communinties” seem polysemantic and big clusters (explains why so much overlap, hence edges)
        - do they form these edges as they all overlap on the same features? (eg. the “.” or the “one” community subgraphs)
        - the “one” subgraph is wing on bottom, and “.” subgraph is wing on top. is their path/etc distance similar across model’s feature spaces?

- ✅ compare mapper graphs of 1L and 2L, 16k MLP0
    - both models have a “one” subgraph
        - 1L
            
            ![Untitled](../SAE%20Mapper%20Explora%2025727d275b3b4da1bd2f67d2a0c30632/Untitled%202.png)

        - there are 5 nodes in the 1L subgraph, and 4 nodes in the 2L subgraph. The common nodes seem to form a “tetrahedron-like” (connectivity wise, but in 2D) subgraph, and the 1L has 5 nodes as it has a “dangling” node which contains 20 features. The 1L clusters have around 40-100 features, while the 2L clusters have around 200.
    - 1L has “.” subgraph, and 2L has “,” subgraph
        - 1L

    - What’s the “path distance” from say the “one” community subgraph to the “.” community subgraph across models?
        
        
    - Both models have a “tail” containing two “a” feature clusters, though this tail is longer in the 1L model. The tails in both feature spaces seems separated by the wings with many “polysemantic” clusters of unrelated features in between.
        - 1L

    - summary (msg to kiho)
        
        here's the (very crude) plots for 2 models if you want to explore them in a browser (just open them). they look like creatures with heads/wings/tails. they form similar subgraph communities such as "one" or "." that seem to be on the "wings" of both models, but this is not precise and is a rough qualitative observation that is subject to an illusion. will investigate more and measure with more rigorous metohds like  Multi-Scale Intrinsic Distance

    - [why do we need cca, cka, mnn? why not just cosine sim?](https://chatgpt.com/c/4e010143-72eb-4278-b7f2-e89601dc1592)
        
        The need for Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA), Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA), and Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) over simpler methods like cosine similarity arises from the complexities and nuances of comparing high-dimensional data and neural network representations. Here are the key reasons:
        
        ### 1. **Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)**
        
        ### Purpose:
        
        CCA is used to understand the relationship between two sets of variables by finding linear combinations of the variables that are maximally correlated.
        
        ### Why Not Just Cosine Similarity:
        
        - **Dimensionality and Alignment**: Cosine similarity measures the angle between two vectors but does not account for the relationships between sets of variables. CCA, on the other hand, considers multiple dimensions and finds a projection where the correlations are maximized.
        - **Inter-set Relationships**: CCA is specifically designed to find the relationships between two sets of variables, not just individual vectors, making it more suitable for tasks like understanding the similarity between two datasets or neural network layer representations.
        
        ### 2. **Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA)**
        
        ### Purpose:
        
        CKA is used to compare the similarity between representations learned by different neural networks or different layers within a network, considering both linear and non-linear relationships.
        
        ### Why Not Just Cosine Similarity:
        
        - **Non-linear Relationships**: CKA uses kernels to capture non-linear relationships between representations, which cosine similarity cannot.
        - **Alignment and Centering**: CKA aligns and centers the data to remove the influence of mean differences, providing a more robust comparison across different representations.
        - **Invariant to Isometric Transformations**: CKA is invariant to orthogonal transformations and isotropic scaling, making it more reliable when comparing neural network representations.
        
        ### 3. **Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD)**
        
        ### Purpose:
        
        MMD is used to measure the difference between two distributions, often used in the context of generative models to compare generated data to real data.
        
        ### Why Not Just Cosine Similarity:
        
        - **Distribution Comparison**: Cosine similarity is designed to compare individual vectors, not distributions. MMD, on the other hand, compares distributions, making it suitable for tasks like evaluating the quality of generative models.
        - **Kernel Trick**: MMD leverages kernels to capture complex, non-linear discrepancies between distributions, offering a more nuanced comparison than cosine similarity can provide.
        
        ### Summary
        
        While cosine similarity is a straightforward and useful measure for comparing individual vectors, it falls short in the following scenarios:
        
        1. **Relationships Between Sets of Variables**: CCA is better for understanding complex relationships between sets of variables.
        2. **Non-linear Representations**: CKA and MMD use kernels to capture non-linear relationships and differences between distributions.
        3. **Distribution Comparisons**: MMD is specifically designed for comparing distributions, a task for which cosine similarity is not suitable.
        
        Each of these methods offers advantages that make them more appropriate for specific tasks in machine learning and data analysis, addressing the limitations of simpler measures like cosine similarity.
        
    - mnn
        
        Mutual Nearest Neighbors (MNN) is another technique used to compare feature activations or embeddings, particularly in the context of aligning or matching different datasets or representations. It focuses on finding nearest neighbors in a mutual manner, often used in scenarios such as data integration or unsupervised alignment of features. Here’s why MNN might be preferred over simpler metrics like cosine similarity:
        
        ### Why Use MNN Instead of Cosine Similarity
        
        ### Purpose of MNN:
        
        MNN aims to find corresponding features or data points across different datasets by identifying pairs that are mutual nearest neighbors. This method is particularly useful for aligning datasets or embeddings when direct feature comparison is difficult.
        
        ### Advantages of MNN:
        
        1. **Robustness to Noise and Outliers**:
            - **Cosine Similarity**: Measures the similarity between two vectors based solely on the angle between them, which can be sensitive to noise and outliers.
            - **MNN**: By focusing on mutual nearest neighbors, MNN is more robust to noise and outliers, as it relies on mutual agreement between neighbors rather than a single measure of similarity.
        2. **Handling of Complex Alignments**:
            - **Cosine Similarity**: Works well for direct, pairwise comparison of vectors but does not account for more complex alignments or relationships between datasets.
            - **MNN**: Captures complex alignments by identifying mutual nearest neighbors, making it suitable for tasks like batch effect correction in single-cell RNA sequencing or aligning embeddings from different models.
        3. **Contextual Relationships**:
            - **Cosine Similarity**: Ignores the broader context of where a vector lies relative to the rest of the data.
            - **MNN**: Considers the local neighborhood of each point, providing a more contextually aware method for comparing data points.
        4. **Cross-dataset Comparisons**:
            - **Cosine Similarity**: Limited when directly comparing different datasets, as it does not inherently handle differences in scale, distribution, or feature space.
            - **MNN**: Specifically designed to align datasets, even when they come from different conditions or have different distributions.
        
        ### Application Contexts for MNN:
        
        1. **Batch Effect Correction**:
            - In single-cell RNA sequencing, MNN is used to align cells from different batches by finding mutual nearest neighbors, correcting for batch effects.
        2. **Unsupervised Embedding Alignment**:
            - When aligning embeddings from different neural networks or different layers within a network, MNN can find corresponding features without requiring labeled data.
        3. **Data Integration**:
            - Integrating datasets from different sources, especially in bioinformatics or computer vision, where direct feature comparison is challenging due to varying scales and distributions.
        
        ### Summary:
        
        MNN provides a more robust and contextually aware method for comparing and aligning feature activations or embeddings, addressing several limitations of cosine similarity:
        
        1. **Noise and Outlier Sensitivity**: MNN is less sensitive to noise and outliers due to its reliance on mutual agreement between neighbors.
        2. **Complex Alignments**: MNN can handle more complex alignments between datasets, making it suitable for tasks that require integrating or aligning different data sources.
        3. **Contextual Awareness**: By considering the local neighborhood, MNN captures more contextual information than cosine similarity.
        4. **Cross-dataset Applicability**: MNN is specifically designed for comparing and aligning different datasets, overcoming limitations related to scale, distribution, and feature space differences.
        
        Overall, while cosine similarity is a useful tool for simple, direct comparisons, MNN and other techniques like CCA, CKA, and MMD offer more sophisticated methods for comparing high-dimensional data and neural network representations, addressing various complexities and nuances in these tasks.

            - What does "affine rescaling" mean here
                
                Loss recovered: "Affine rescaling" in this context refers to adjusting the average test loss using a linear transformation that includes both scaling and shifting. Essentially, it's a way to normalize the loss values such that:
                
                - 0% loss recovered corresponds to the scenario where the loss is at its highest (equivalent to zero ablating the MLP).
                - 100% loss recovered corresponds to the model's test loss without any modifications.
                
                This transformation makes it easier to compare and interpret the effectiveness of the SAE outputs in recovering the original model's performance.
                
            - is "Affine rescaling" just another way to say "normalized”
                
                "Affine rescaling" specifically refers to a linear transformation involving both scaling (multiplying by a constant) and shifting (adding a constant), whereas "normalized" typically refers to adjusting values to fit within a standard range, often [0, 1], without necessarily involving both scaling and shifting. In the context provided, "affine rescaling" means mapping the loss values to a range where 0% represents the worst-case loss and 100% represents the best-case loss, explicitly using both scaling and shifting.

                ### CE Loss vs. MSE Loss:
                
                **Cross-Entropy (CE) Loss:**
                
                - **Purpose:** Primarily used for classification tasks.
                - **Function:** Measures the difference between two probability distributions – the true distribution and the predicted distribution.
                - **Strength:** Penalizes confident but wrong predictions more heavily, which is crucial for improving classification accuracy.
                
                **Mean Squared Error (MSE) Loss:**
                
                - **Purpose:** Commonly used for regression tasks.
                - **Function:** Calculates the average squared difference between the actual and predicted values.
                - **Strength:** Suitable for tasks where the output is continuous and focuses on reducing overall prediction error.
                
                ### Why Use Both in WandB:
                
                - **Versatility:** Having both losses allows for monitoring and fine-tuning models for different types of tasks (classification and regression).
                - **Comprehensive Analysis:** Provides a broader view of model performance, especially in cases where the model might need to balance between classification accuracy and prediction precision.

        feature spliting shouldnt use topk. 3 features. just one more feature

        if a feature needs to be split into 2, then it should be when width is big
        
        topk breaks a lot of intuitions of feature splitting. introduce a prior.

        Hi, I was wondering if you have time for some advice? I've been trying to modify this plot (attached the html) such that hovering over a point in one scatterplot will create a hover box over another point in a second hover box, based on a list "highest_correlations_indices" in which indices are point ids in scatter plot 2 and the values are the mapped indices in scatter plot 1. I've tried several ways but it hasn't worked. Do you have ideas on how to do this? It uses plotly but I don't think that's the way to do it. I've also attached the code with comments on the input args, and a zip of saved input files. Thanks!

    **Missing**: I didn't reimplement the auxiliary loss which prevents neuron death in top-k SAEs so even though you could train SAEs in this library, it might be inefficient to do so at present.
    
    - msg to jbloom
        
        Hi, I slightly modified the colab code “Training an SAE” to use `activation_fn_str = "topk"` and
        `activation_fn_kwargs = {"k":32}` to train an SAE on tinystories-1L-21M, but it got 12k dead features out of the 16k features (whereas the original ReLU code had only ~20). I was wondering if this has to do with auxiliary loss; was it implemented? I saw issue #201 may not have it. 
        
        One of the things I’m doing is looking for feature splitting on this 1L tinystories model, but while havling/doubling the 16k params and plotting the weights on the same umap shows weights activating on similar tokens next to one another, I don’t really see feature splitting. The weights are activating on tokens like “upon” or punctuation; they combine concepts like “dragon, princess, king” to one feature and don’t seperate them. Do you think topK (L0=32) would help with this, or would it not? I also tried 100k training steps; would more steps help? Looking for general advice to get feature splitting. The tutorial already seems to get good sparsity and loss recovered.
        
    - response
        
        We didn't implement that yet. If you'd like to I'd accept a demonstrably working PR for the auxilliary loss for top k. This should fix dead features . idk how tuning k with top k as Ive not trained with top k myself.

    - ✅ send umap (color once and upon) to luke
        
        I attached a umap of sae feature decoder weights for 16k width SAEs trained on MLP0 of tinystories 1L-21M and 2L-33M. It uses n_neighbors=15, metric="cosine", and min_dist=0.01. The plots are simple for now, where hovering over a point gives the top 5 highest activating tokens from 500 samples of the tinystories dataset (will scale this up to more soon). I’m also working on making it so that hovering over a point in one umap will create a hover box over another point in a second hover box umap. Don’t think can be done in plotly, I’m looking into svelte. Secondly, there are 16k points, but some features like those that capture “princess” are few so hard to see, so it would be better to have a function that zooms into both plots when searching up this keyword.
        
        A few caveats on the “projection/clustering illusions”; in UMAP, distances between clusters are likely to be meaningless due to using local distances when constructing the graph. UMAP runs are also stochastic at certain steps. Lastly, I’m looking to train SAEs that capture ground-truth features better (and more monosemantic), but I’m not seeing feature splitting occurring when I try to replicate the feature splitting plots from Towards Monosemanticity. 
        
        Next, as you mentioned, I’m probably going to look into seeing how similar SAEs on different toy models with synthetic features are (would it be feasible to train dozens of toy models?); these could be a test bed for various more quantitative measures I’m testing (MNN, MSID, etc) than just looking at UMAP/Mapper (not rigorous).
        
- 🐣 Try Mutual Nearest Neighbors code
    - [is Mutual Nearest Neighbors the same as knn](https://chatgpt.com/c/2095e7e3-2e1b-4210-87a5-7558ec19df55)
        
        Mutual Nearest Neighbors (MNN) and k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) are related concepts in machine learning and data analysis but they are not the same.
        
        ### k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)
        
        kNN is a classification and regression algorithm that operates by finding the k closest training examples in the feature space to a given query point. The "closeness" is typically measured using a distance metric like Euclidean distance. In the case of classification, the query point is assigned the label most common among its k nearest neighbors. For regression, the query point is assigned the average value of its k nearest neighbors.
        
        **Key points:**
        
        - Finds the k closest points in the feature space.
        - Used for both classification and regression tasks.
        - Distance metrics (e.g., Euclidean, Manhattan) are used to determine closeness.
        
        ### Mutual Nearest Neighbors (MNN)
        
        MNN, on the other hand, is a concept often used in the context of data integration, especially in single-cell RNA sequencing data analysis. It identifies pairs of points that are mutual nearest neighbors between two datasets. This means that point A from dataset 1 is one of the k nearest neighbors of point B in dataset 2, and vice versa.
        
        **Key points:**
        
        - Used primarily for aligning and integrating datasets.
        - Focuses on finding pairs of points that are nearest neighbors of each other across two datasets.
        - Helps in removing batch effects and aligning data from different conditions or experiments.
        
        ### Summary
        
        - **kNN** finds the k nearest neighbors of a query point within a single dataset and is used for classification and regression.
        - **MNN** identifies pairs of points that are mutual nearest neighbors between two datasets, commonly used for data integration tasks.
        
        Thus, while both concepts involve the idea of "nearest neighbors," their purposes and implementations are quite different.

There are some TDA people I am looking to contact, and I was also wondering if you are familiar with people who work in this field (who may also be looking to collaborate, but not necessary)?

    Main
    
    - look for metrics other than clustering in high dim space- may be illusions of closeness due to many ways to get projections?
    - want to get advice on which methods to look into before spending a lot of time looking into them
    - first assmp: if give same sentence, token always gets same sentence. but stochastic repr for var autoen. but in llm things are determ
    - second assmp: just use same tokenizer
    
    Secondary:
    
    - what do you think of distance metrics in sae space? given its sparsity, two vectors might not have any dimensions in common, so would "distance" be roughly the manhattan distance? would it be better to use mutual nearest neighbors instead of euclidean distance to measure feature vector distance then?
    - CKA issues
    - platonic repr hyp paper: if mnn is kenenl-alignment metric, what’s the kernel in both spaces? is it nearest neighbors? then the metric between kernels is set intersection?
    - actv sim is not the only way to compare saes; cosine sim also works. thus, can compare across models with diff tokenizers?

    CKA: can manip scores. differne and add to loss, but paint any pic you want using lay by layer heatmaps. models still work but repr sims between diff layers are arbitrary. potential problem. models arent realistic. what extent transfer to real models. 
    
    bnechmark for sim metrics. rank metrics. cka most popular, but if test variants, cka is good but not great. orig paper still valid, just didnt test enough. L2 finds L2 is supposed to most sim- thats a big assumption.
    
    1) not develop a method but use existing methods and assume that they work well, and just measure similarity scores of spaces and subspaces.
    
    indiv axis of LLM arent meaningful (not priv)
    
    sae dims- each axis is aligned with meaning. use sim measure thats not invar to rotations, use soft matching 
    
    mutual nearest neighbors
    
    rank 23 metrics: layer test, JSD corr, etc. avg of tests. 
    
    test in same framework
    
    models from hf auto collect actvs
    
    sim metrics invar to rotations: dont use cca bc assumes linear transf from one model to another for efatures, but arb lin combo of features make them not interp (oppo). best metrics: permutation procrustes, instead of orth matrix just use perm matrix to match repr. scipy lienar sum assignment problem. soft matching is imprv of this- tries to match features, but can also match featues in distrb manner. feat is 80% of B1 and 20% of B2. this is more flexible and still only invar to permutations. order of features doesnt matter, but doesnt destroy meaning of directions. convert orig features in new space in cca and diff dims dontt have particular monosemantic feature.
    
    methods- just say holds, these sim metrics are stronger if can extract repr that intuitiely for some other easons. apply sim metrics to ground truth synethic data to see if metrics hold. if so, then can use metrics on models where we dont know groudn turth features.
    
    feature subspaces- can also just take subset and use metrics. model merging. 
    
    topo distances: invariance to rotation but not sure. sometimes can ignore theory and it just works. main problem: geometry score and MSID are pretty slow. high dim may be quadratic. need a lot of samples.  didnt use geom score on benchmark. try it on small toy model with low dims.
    
    sae benchmark: can do it without benchmark bc empirically many papers pass peer review dont use benchmark. create good test. see if results are intersting before get good test. for instance, soft matching dist, stochastic matrix . use probs/scores for features across models to find consistently match features. alignment matrix that maps features to other features is a graph and do clustering.
    
    no guar will find anythin intersting- so risky. dont need to compare techniques to baseline. sae throughout training LLM. see emergence of specific features.
    
    try both perm proc and soft match. first is strict 1-1, other is 1 to multiple. great for clustering. 
    
    last layer, last token- both vers of papers do that. others reverse tokenization and go backwards. get avg of word repr. valid to also just use same tokenizer. BUT if use diff tokenizers,
    
    decoder uses last repr- so all info is already theree. so last token is very impt. only applies to last layer. if go to diff layers, check which words get same tokenization. maybe works out. otherwise, makes sense to aggregate tokens per word. to be agnostic to tokenizer (future papers)
    
    repr space metrics: an aggre measure of relations beween such pts- some are (jaccard, mnn)
    
    some arent- cka
    
    since can use stitching layers to transform repr of one layer to another layer, there needs to some partial correspondance between models. one assmp is bc can match things, there is some reoccurence of features.
    
    RSA have control over invariant bc pariwise dist, dep on how you do that, would have diff invar. may work. sae best use perm based stuff.

    For Permutation Procrustes (One-to-One Matching Distance) and Soft-Matching Distance, you can take a look at [http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09466](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09466)
    
    I don’t have code for the soft version, but I have computed Permutation Procrustes with
    
    `PR, PRp = scipy.optimize.linear_sum_assignment(R.T @ Rp, maximize=True)  # returns column assignments`
    
    `distance = float(np.linalg.norm(R[:, PR] - Rp[:, PRp], ord="fro"))`
    
    where R and Rp are collections of representations with shape num_samples x num_dimensions.
    
    Like I mentioned, my coauthor and I are aiming to push an updated version of our survey to arxiv very soon. Our follow-up work that proposes a benchmark for similarity measures should reach arxiv just before that. I will contact you once it is available.
    
- ✅ read: [https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/z6QQJbtpkEAX3Aojj/interim-research-report-taking-features-out-of-superposition](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/z6QQJbtpkEAX3Aojj/interim-research-report-taking-features-out-of-superposition)
    - ISSUE: note that this trains SAEs on synthetic activations, not on toy LLMs. These are activations which simulate one LLM’s activations already. So either use these approaches:
        - train LLM on synthetic data in a similar way. not sure hwo to even approach this as the previous post use synthetic activations, not synthetic text, so it doesn’t even work.
        - use two synthetic activations which share features but combine them in different ways. This simulates two different LLMs
    - ask max on MMCSq
        
        This is the approach I'm experimenting with right now- they create a set of synthetic activations to simulate one LLM, then use MMCS, mean max cosine similarity, between the learned dictionary D and the ground truth features F to measure how well the learned dictionary recovered the ground truth features:
        
        https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/z6QQJbtpkEAX3Aojj/interim-research-report-taking-features-out-of-superposition
        
        What do you think about using MMCS to compare two SAE feature decoder weights? I think the metrics depend on measuring weights or feature activations; I'm looking to experiment with both cases.
        
    - notes
        - After defining the ground truth features, we then constructed sparse ground truth feature coefficients by (1) sampling from a G-dimensional binary random variable that takes 0 with high probability and 1 with low probability such that on average 5 out of G ground truth features are active at a time, and (2) scaling those sparse binary vectors by multiplying them with a G-dimensional vector where each element is sampled from a uniform distribution between 0 and 1 to obtain an ‘activation’ for that feature.
        - stickiness means y-axis value is constant across an interval on x-axis (plateau)
        - **One of the main things we’d like to identify are the properties of the language model activations that cause the differences from the toy model**
        - If we continue this line of research, we’ll probably also explore better metrics for ground truth feature recovery than mean max cosine similarity. Currently, MMCS only accounts for the maximally similar dictionary element for each ground truth element. But dictionaries may have learned redundant copies of ground truth features, which MMCS fails to account for. An improved metric may be especially important if we explore variable levels of feature correlation and more variable differences between features’ probabilities (i.e. feature probability decay). MMCS also relies on cosine similarity, which will scale poorly as the sizes of our dictionaries increase for realistic models.
        - It would be nice to know if the difference we’re seeing between the toy data and the langauge model results are due to there simply being too many features being in superposition in the langauge model or if it’s due to something about MLP activations in transformers. One way we could address this in future experiments is to train a transformer on a simpler, algorithmic task, rather than natural language. Algorithmic tasks can have fewer features than in natural language, so we might see less superposition as well as be able to precisely quantify probable ranges of feature sparsity.
        - In their current formulation, SAEs leave a few important problems unaddressed, including:
            - SAEs probably don't learn the most functionally relevant features. They find directions in the activations that are separable, but that doesn't *necessarily* reflect the network's ontology. The features learned by SAEs are probably too granular.
            - SAEs don't automatically provide a way to summarize the interactions between features (i.e. there is a gap between features and circuits).

        - exlain the reasons for using each of these choices: we created a random covariance matrix for a multivariate normal distribution with zero mean. We took a single sample from a correlated multivariate normal distribution and, for each dimension of that sample, found where that sample lay on the standard normal cumulative distribution function.
            1. **Random Covariance Matrix for a Multivariate Normal Distribution with Zero Mean**:
                - **Reason**: The covariance matrix defines the relationships between features. A multivariate normal distribution with zero mean is a standard choice because it is well-understood and mathematically convenient. The zero mean simplifies calculations without loss of generality.
            2. **Single Sample from a Correlated Multivariate Normal Distribution**:
                - **Reason**: By sampling from this distribution, we generate a set of values that inherently follow the correlation structure defined by the covariance matrix. This mimics the real-world scenario where certain features tend to occur together.
            3. **Mapping Sample Values to the Standard Normal Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)**:
                - **Reason**: The CDF transforms the values into a uniform range (0, 1), preserving the correlations. This step ensures that the resulting binary variables (features being active or not) have the desired correlation structure. This transformation is key to converting continuous values into probabilities that reflect the original correlations.
            
            In summary, these choices allow the researchers to create a realistic model of feature correlations using well-established mathematical tools.
            
        - the probability of the G-dimensional random variable exponentially decayed with the feature’s index. why Exponential Decay?
            
            **Exponential Decay Reasoning**:
            
            1. **Realistic Feature Distribution**: In real-world data, certain features are inherently more common than others. Exponential decay mirrors this natural skewness by making some features appear much more frequently.
            2. **Controlled Variability**: The decay parameter (\(\lambda\)) allows fine-tuning of how quickly feature frequencies drop. This creates a more nuanced distribution, where a few features dominate while others become progressively rarer.
            3. **Mathematical Convenience**: Exponential functions are mathematically well-understood and computationally efficient, making them a practical choice for modeling such distributions.
            
            In summary, exponential decay provides a realistic, adjustable, and mathematically convenient way to simulate feature frequencies.

- ✅ plan next expm steps
    - Studying existing representational similarity metrics to find which ones would fit the assumptions for SAE feature spaces (have privileged basis so rotation invariant, etc)
    - use multiple synthetic activatiosn to simuate multp toy mods
        
        To verify how accurate each metric is for measuring SAE feature space similarity, we first test each metric on SAEs trained on synthetic activations that simulate toy model activations and are combinations of known ground truth features. These activations are constructed using the approach of \cite{sharkey2022interim}. \textcolor{blue}{An important note is that these experiments do use not toy toy models trained on synthetic text data, but directly use activations which are sparse linear combinations of known ground truth feature directions.} Thus, no toy models are trained; only SAEs are trained. The reason we start with synthetic activation experiments instead of with activations on larger LLMs is because we don’t know the ground truth features that these LLMs learn, and thus don’t know which features should be similar.
        
        \cite{sharkey2022interim} only use one set of synthetic activations to simulate the activations of one toy model; however, since we are comparing SAEs from across multiple models, we use multiple sets of synthetic activations. For the following experiments, we use two synthetic activations which share ground truth features, but linearly combine them into activations in different ways. This simulates two different toy models.
        
        Our experiments record which ground truth features each SAE learns to ensure they’re similar, and use multiple, theoretically valid, metrics to assess their similarity, looking at which metrics correctly find that they’re similar. We compare these results to non-similar SAEs trained on LLMs with different features to ensure they also say those SAEs are not similar.

    I was wondering if you can assess the validity of this paragraph? It’s one part of a longer experimental setup writeup (I can send that later if requested):
    
    \cite{sharkey2022interim} only use one set of synthetic activations to simulate the activations of one toy model; however, since we are comparing SAEs from across multiple models, we use multiple sets of synthetic activations. For the following experiments, we use N sets of synthetic activations which linearly combine shared ground truth features into activations in different ways. This simulates N different toy models.
    

EXPMS- Sim metrics on ground truth features

- 🐣 explora: toy models from luke’s code
    
    [synthData_explora.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1lHOtRa8KHIZuqbetilKkZFypfHDnSz2M#scrollTo=PLIDVkYupqYY)
    
    - ✅ `from tqdm import tqdm  # must do this to call to fn, not tqdm module from "import tqdm", for batch_start in tqdm()`
    - ✅ can’t use saelens as that is trained on a model in its cfg, not synth actvs
    - ✅ luke’s code uses class `SparseAutoencoder` as the self.model in `SAETrainer`. `SparseAutoencoder` has an `nn.ModuleList` of encoders
        - ✅ Each SAE uses a params from `parameter_grid` (this does hyperparam sweep?). This finds dicts that are combos of the values in `parameter_grid`
            
            ```
            combinations_generator = find_combinations(parameter_grid)
            one_combination = next(combinations_generator)
            ```
            
        - ✅ the model is locally defined within `train_synthetic_sae`, and not returned, so we need to find one globally in order to extract its weights to use UMAP + our own metrics on it
        - ✅ as seen in `trainer.train,` the SAEs are located in `trainer.model.encoders.` We can obtain the hxJ matrix using `trainer.model.encoders[0].weight.detach().t()`
            - the name suggests these are encoder weights. But are they?
                
                The encoder is followed by a learned dictionary of features, D, which is a h×J decoder matrix (with no bias) whose columns (the learned features)
                
                J = G x 2. So are `trainer.model.encoders`. So those may be decoders.
                
                But luke’s paper has W (encoder) be hxJ
                
                SOLN: `trainer.model.encoders[0].weight.detach().shape` is Gxh because `.t()` is transpose. So in paper, encoder is hxG, but in code (luke’s and saelen’s), encoder is Gxh. So don’t take transpose when doing umap
                
                - Regardless of which they are, we can still plot any weights in UMAP as long as the feature weights (the cols) are the rows (just take transpose). And we can still use MMCS and other metrics on these cols.
                    
                    [the reason encoder weights may have failed before is bc you didnt plot the feature weights on rows, while decoder weights uses feature weights as rows {thou thye should be cols} in saelens]
                    
    - 🐣 get rid of the mutual reg loss, if it’s there
- ✅ UMAP plot ground truth feats matrix + SAE enc_weights trained on synthetic actvs to see if they form clusters. they shouldn’t bc they’re uniform; or would they, bc they’re correlated?
    
    
- ✅ where in the code does it take corr ground truth features into lin combos of saes?
    
    `X` (batches) are the activations of toy model, while `Fe` are the ground truth features. SAE is trained on train_loader, which uses X.
    
    ```
    train_dataset = TensorDataset(X)
    torch.save(train_dataset, 'synthetic_dataset.pth')
    train_loader = DataLoader(train_dataset, batch_size=2048, shuffle=True)
    ```
    
- ✅ after making the features correlated, would the features still be in uniform distribution? would it have distinct clusters or shapes in data?
    
    After making the features correlated, the distribution of features would no longer be uniform. Instead, the data would likely show patterns reflecting these correlations, meaning certain features are more likely to appear together.
    
    ### Key Changes in Distribution:
    
    1. **Loss of Uniformity**: Originally uniform feature distributions are transformed to reflect the defined correlations, leading to non-uniform distributions.
    2. **Clusters and Patterns**: The correlated features might form distinct clusters or exhibit specific shapes in the data, depending on how strong the correlations are and how the exponential decay affects feature frequencies.
    
    ### Detailed Effects:
    
    - **Clusters**: Features that are strongly correlated might cluster together in the data, meaning instances where one feature is present will likely include others.
    - **Shapes**: Depending on the correlation structure and decay parameters, the data could form more complex shapes, reflecting high-dimensional correlations and variable feature frequencies.
    
    Thus, the process introduces more structure and pattern into the feature space, departing from a simple uniform distribution.
    
- ✅ It doesn’t matter about the actvs, bc the code should make ground truth features be corr, not when they’re put into actvs X. Find the code that does this.
    
    `generate_synthetic_data` does this in `group_probs`. 
    
- ✅ However, Luke’s code does not modify the `true_features` correlations; only modifies them when choosing coeffs for the activation vectors.
- ✅ QUES: Modify so capture feature relns. Does it make sense if all come from unif distr?
    - perhaps yes, since it’s features that come from unif distr, not the correlated activations
        - but we want to capture FEATURE relations. this is still poss valid- they make correlated FEATURES (not actvs)
        - Actually, not valid- only makes corr when sel coeffs for actvs, NOT changing orig feat distr!
- 🐣 msg to luke about non-unif:
    
    Also, as I’m looking to use metrics that compare how well the SAEs for different LLMs capture the feature space (comparing how well they detect distinct clusters + shapes), I was looking to use features that form interesting arrangements with one another. I was wondering if this is a correct interpretation and what you think of it:
    
    In the “Taking features out of…” post, ground truth features are from sampled from a uniform distribution, and they’re only made correlated when put into linear combinations, as the coefficients of the activation vectors are selected based on the feature frequencies.
    
    So the ground truth features would still form a uniform distribution, and the SAE encoder or decoder weights would also form a uniform distribution. Meaning their UMAP plots wouldn’t show semantic clusters like those seen in “Scaling Monosemanticity”, and wouldn’t be that interesting.
    
    Thus, would it make sense to modify the synthetic activations generation so that ground truth features are not from a uniform distribution, but from a feature space with clusters and other shapes?
    
- 🐣 [msg to chatgpt- does this procedure allow for meaningful feature relns](https://chatgpt.com/c/e9a4090b-e560-40d7-aad0-a64c00cf0995)
    - same msg to chatgpt
        
        Your interpretation is correct, and it makes sense to modify the synthetic activations generation to create a more interesting feature space. Here's a detailed explanation
        
        ### Current Interpretation:
        
        - **Uniform Ground Truth Features**: In the original setup, ground truth features are sampled from a uniform distribution.
        - **Correlations in Linear Combinations**: Features are made correlated when combined into activation vectors, but individually they remain uniformly distributed.
        - **Resulting Distributions**: This leads to uniform distributions in both ground truth features and SAE weights, resulting in less interesting UMAP plots without clear semantic clusters.
        
        ### Modifying the Synthetic Activations:
        
        To generate more interesting feature arrangements:
        
        1. **Non-Uniform Ground Truth Features**: Sample ground truth features from a distribution that naturally forms clusters or other shapes. This can be done by:
            - Introducing correlations directly among features during sampling.
            - Using a known non-uniform distribution with cluster-forming properties (e.g., Gaussian mixtures).
        2. **Generating Synthetic Activations**:
            - Ensure that the activation vectors reflect these non-uniformly distributed features.
            - Maintain or enhance the correlations between features in a way that highlights distinct clusters and patterns.
        
        ### Benefits:
        
        - **Interesting Arrangements**: The modified feature space will likely form distinct clusters and shapes, making it easier to visualize and analyze using techniques like UMAP.
        - **Comparative Metrics**: This setup allows for better comparison of how different SAEs capture and represent complex feature spaces, providing more insight into their effectiveness.
        
        In summary, modifying the synthetic activations to create a more structured feature space with inherent clusters and shapes will make your analysis more meaningful and visually informative.
        
    - Devise a procedure of synthetic activation generation that allows for meaningful feature relations like clusters and circles in ground truth feature space to be captured by SAEs, using metrics like mutual nearest neighbors and soft matching distance to compare how similar the feature arrangements are of SAEs trained on two different toy model simulations
        
        ### Procedure for Generating Synthetic Activations with Meaningful Feature Relations
        
        1. **Define Ground Truth Features**:
            - Create clusters and shapes like circles within the feature space.
            - Use a mixture of Gaussians for clusters and parametric equations for shapes (e.g., circles).
        2. **Introduce Correlations**:
            - Use a covariance matrix to introduce correlations within and between clusters.
            - Ensure features within the same cluster have higher correlations.
        3. **Sample Features**:
            - Sample from the defined distributions to create the ground truth feature vectors.
            - Ensure the sampling maintains the designed structures.
        4. **Transform to Binary/Activation Values**:
            - Apply a transformation (e.g., thresholding or sigmoid function) to convert continuous values to binary activations.
        5. **Generate Activation Vectors**:
            - Combine features linearly, using coefficients that reflect feature frequencies and correlations.
            - Introduce noise to simulate real-world scenarios.
        6. **Train Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs)**:
            - Train SAEs on the generated activation vectors from different toy model simulations.
            - Ensure consistent hyperparameters for comparability.
        
        ### Evaluation Metrics
        
        1. **Mutual Nearest Neighbors (MNN)**:
            - Compute MNN between the encoded feature spaces of the two SAEs.
            - High MNN indicates similar feature arrangements.
        2. **Soft Matching Distance (SMD)**:
            - Measure the distance between distributions of features in the encoded spaces.
            - Lower SMD indicates closer resemblance in feature arrangement.
        
        ### Steps for Comparison
        
        1. **Generate Synthetic Data**:
            - Follow the above procedure to generate synthetic activation data for two different toy models.
        2. **Train SAEs**:
            - Train one SAE on each set of synthetic data.
        3. **Extract Encodings**:
            - Obtain the encoded feature representations from both SAEs.
        4. **Apply Metrics**:
            - Use MNN and SMD to compare the similarity of the encoded feature spaces.
        5. **Analyze Results**:
            - Interpret the results to understand how well each SAE captures the designed feature relations.
        
        This procedure ensures that the synthetic data contains meaningful relationships, allowing for a robust comparison of how well different SAEs capture and represent these relationships.
        
    - Explain more "Use a mixture of Gaussians for clusters " intuitively and detail procedure wise why ti works
        
        ### Mixture of Gaussians Intuitively Explained
        
        A **Mixture of Gaussians** (MoG) is a statistical model used to represent data as a collection of clusters, where each cluster follows a Gaussian (normal) distribution. Intuitively, think of it as multiple "blobs" of data points, each blob representing a different cluster with its own mean (center) and variance (spread).
        
        ### Why It Works
        
        - **Natural Clustering**: Many real-world data sets have cluster structures. A MoG can naturally model these clusters.
        - **Flexibility**: By adjusting the parameters (means and variances) of each Gaussian, we can create diverse shapes and densities, capturing complex relationships in the data.
        - **Mathematical Tractability**: Gaussian distributions are well-studied and have desirable mathematical properties, making them easy to work with.
        
        ### Procedure to Create Synthetic Activations Using MoG
        
        1. **Define Clusters**:
            - Choose the number of clusters \( K \).
            - For each cluster, define the mean vector \( \mu_k \) and covariance matrix \( \Sigma_k \). The mean vector sets the center, and the covariance matrix defines the shape and spread.
        2. **Sample Data Points**:
            - For each cluster \( k \):
                - Determine the number of points \( n_k \) to sample (proportional to the cluster’s weight).
                - Sample \( n_k \) points from a multivariate normal distribution \( \mathcal{N}(\mu_k, \Sigma_k) \).
        3. **Combine Clusters**:
            - Combine the sampled points from all clusters into a single data set. This results in a synthetic data set with distinct clusters.
        4. **Generate Activation Vectors**:
            - Use the sampled points as ground truth features.
            - Create activation vectors by combining these features linearly, preserving the cluster structure.
        
        ### Example
        
        Let's create a synthetic data set with three clusters:
        
        1. **Define Parameters**:
            - Cluster 1: \( \mu_1 = [1, 1] \), \( \Sigma_1 = [[0.1, 0], [0, 0.1]] \)
            - Cluster 2: \( \mu_2 = [5, 5] \), \( \Sigma_2 = [[0.2, 0.1], [0.1, 0.2]] \)
            - Cluster 3: \( \mu_3 = [8, 1] \), \( \Sigma_3 = [[0.3, 0], [0, 0.3]] \)
        2. **Sample Points**:
            - From \( \mathcal{N}(\mu_1, \Sigma_1) \), sample 100 points.
            - From \( \mathcal{N}(\mu_2, \Sigma_2) \), sample 100 points.
            - From \( \mathcal{N}(\mu_3, \Sigma_3) \), sample 100 points.
        3. **Combine and Visualize**:
            - Combine the 300 points and plot them. The plot will show three distinct clusters.
        4. **Generate Activation Vectors**:
            - Use these 300 points as features and create activation vectors by combining them linearly.
        
        ### Metrics for Comparison
        
        1. **Mutual Nearest Neighbors (MNN)**:
            - For each feature in one SAE, find its nearest neighbors in the other SAE’s feature space.
            - Calculate the proportion of mutual nearest neighbors.
        2. **Soft Matching Distance (SMD)**:
            - Measure the distance between the distributions of features in the two SAEs’ encoded spaces.
            - Use a metric like the Earth Mover’s Distance to compute this.
        
        This procedure ensures that the synthetic data contains meaningful relationships, allowing for a robust comparison of how well different SAEs capture and represent these relationships.

        ### Explanation
        
        1. **Gaussian Mixture Generation**:
            - **Parameters**: Define the number of samples, means, and covariances for each Gaussian cluster.
            - **Function**: `generate_gaussian_mixture()` generates samples from a mixture of Gaussians.
        2. **Synthetic Activation Vectors**:
            - **Parameters**: Specify the number of activation vectors.
            - **Function**: `create_activation_vectors()` combines the ground truth features linearly to create activation vectors.
        3. **Visualization**:
            - **Plots**: Visualize the ground truth features and synthetic activation vectors to see the clusters and relationships.
        
        This code creates a meaningful feature space with clusters, generating synthetic activations that reflect these structures. You can then use these synthetic activations to train SAEs and compare their performance using metrics like mutual nearest neighbors and soft matching distance.
        
    - what other approaches can be used to simulate interesting feature spaces? don't need distinct clusters
        
        Here are several approaches to simulate interesting feature spaces without creating distinct clusters:
        
        ### 1. **Manifold Learning**
        
        - **Description**: Generate data that lies on or near a low-dimensional manifold within a higher-dimensional space.
        - **Approach**: Use techniques like t-SNE, Isomap, or locally linear embedding (LLE) to create complex, nonlinear structures.
        - **Example**: Generate points on a Swiss roll or an S-curve.
        
        ### 2. **Fractal Patterns**
        
        - **Description**: Create features based on fractal patterns which have self-similarity and intricate structures.
        - **Approach**: Use mathematical formulas like the Mandelbrot set or Julia set to generate data points.
        - **Example**: Generate points from a fractal formula and add noise for variation.
        
        ### 3. **Periodic Functions**
        
        - **Description**: Use periodic functions (sine, cosine) to create wave-like structures.
        - **Approach**: Combine multiple sine and cosine functions with different frequencies and amplitudes.
        - **Example**: Create data that forms a wave pattern in multiple dimensions.
        
        ### 4. **Latent Variable Models**
        
        - **Description**: Generate data from a model where observed variables are influenced by unobserved latent variables.
        - **Approach**: Use models like Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs), Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), or Variational Autoencoders (VAEs).
        - **Example**: Generate data points influenced by a few latent factors that create interesting dependencies.
        
        ### 5. **Complex Geometric Shapes**
        
        - **Description**: Generate data based on complex geometric shapes.
        - **Approach**: Use mathematical definitions of shapes like tori, hypercubes, or spheres.
        - **Example**: Points distributed on the surface of a torus or inside a hypercube.
        
        ### 6. **Noise-Infused Patterns**
        
        - **Description**: Create data with inherent patterns but infused with various types of noise.
        - **Approach**: Define an underlying pattern (linear, quadratic) and add Gaussian, Poisson, or uniform noise.
        - **Example**: Linear trend with Gaussian noise to simulate noisy observations.
        
        ### 7. **Simulated Physical Systems**
        
        - **Description**: Model data based on physical systems or processes.
        - **Approach**: Use simulations of physical phenomena like fluid dynamics, weather patterns, or particle systems.
        - **Example**: Data points representing the movement of particles in a fluid.
        
        ### 8. **Graph-based Features**
        
        - **Description**: Generate data that represents nodes and edges in a graph.
        - **Approach**: Use graph generation algorithms like Erdos-Renyi, Barabasi-Albert, or Watts-Strogatz.
        - **Example**: Nodes representing people in a social network with edges indicating relationships.
        
        ### Example Code for Generating Data on a Swiss Roll:
        
        ```python
        import numpy as np
        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        from sklearn.datasets import make_swiss_roll
        
        # Generate Swiss Roll Data
        n_samples = 1000
        noise = 0.1
        X, _ = make_swiss_roll(n_samples, noise)
        
        # Plot Swiss Roll Data
        fig = plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
        ax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection='3d')
        ax.scatter(X[:, 0], X[:, 1], X[:, 2], c=X[:, 0], cmap='Spectral', s=5)
        ax.set_title("Swiss Roll Data")
        plt.show()
        
        ```
        
        This code generates and visualizes data points on a Swiss roll, creating an interesting nonlinear structure in 3D space.
        
    - what's good resources for Mixture of Gaussians specific to what you used
        
        
    - these talk about clustering, not distribution sampling from an artificial distr of data. why is that?
        
        When you look for resources about Mixture of Gaussians (MoG) in the context of clustering, it's because MoG is frequently used for clustering applications. However, the same principles apply to distribution sampling, as the underlying mechanism involves modeling data with a mixture of Gaussian distributions. Here’s a more focused approach for generating synthetic data:
        
        ### Sampling from a Mixture of Gaussians
        
        1. **Understanding the Model**:
            - **Gaussian Components**: Each Gaussian component represents a cluster.
            - **Weights**: Each component has a weight (probability) indicating its prevalence.
        2. **Generating Samples**:
            - **Step-by-Step**:
                1. **Define Parameters**:
                    - Means, covariances, and weights for each Gaussian.
                2. **Component Selection**:
                    - Randomly choose a Gaussian component based on weights.
                3. **Sampling**:
                    - Sample from the chosen Gaussian distribution.
        
        ### Detailed Procedure
        
        1. **Define Parameters**:
            
            ```python
            import numpy as np
            import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
            
            # Parameters for the Gaussians
            means = [np.array([1, 1]), np.array([5, 5]), np.array([8, 1])]
            covariances = [np.array([[0.1, 0], [0, 0.1]]),
                           np.array([[0.2, 0.1], [0.1, 0.2]]),
                           np.array([[0.3, 0], [0, 0.3]])]
            weights = [0.3, 0.4, 0.3]  # Sum should be 1
            
            ```
            
        2. **Component Selection and Sampling**:
            
            ```python
            def sample_from_mog(n_samples, means, covariances, weights):
                n_components = len(weights)
                samples = []
            
                for _ in range(n_samples):
                    component = np.random.choice(n_components, p=weights)
                    sample = np.random.multivariate_normal(means[component], covariances[component])
                    samples.append(sample)
            
                return np.array(samples)
            
            # Generate samples
            n_samples = 300
            samples = sample_from_mog(n_samples, means, covariances, weights)
            
            # Plot the samples
            plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
            plt.scatter(samples[:, 0], samples[:, 1], alpha=0.6)
            plt.title("Samples from Mixture of Gaussians")
            plt.xlabel("Feature 1")
            plt.ylabel("Feature 2")
            plt.grid(True)
            plt.show()
            
            ```
            
        
        ### Explanation
        
        - **Parameters**: Define the means, covariances, and weights for each Gaussian component.
        - **Component Selection**: Randomly choose which Gaussian to sample from based on the weights.
        - **Sampling**: Draw a sample from the chosen Gaussian distribution.
        
        ### Additional Resources
        
        - **Scikit-learn Documentation**: Although primarily about clustering, [scikit-learn’s Gaussian Mixture](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/mixture.html) provides functions that can be adapted for sampling.
        - **Statistical Textbooks**: Books like "Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning" by Christopher Bishop cover MoG in detail, including sampling.
        
        This approach allows you to create synthetic data with complex structures without predefined clusters, making it suitable for various simulations and analyses.
        
    - would umap of make_blobs or make_circles data look uniform?
        
        The UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) visualization of data generated using `make_blobs` or `make_circles` would not look uniform. Here's why:
        
        ### `make_blobs`:
        
        - **Clusters**: This function generates data in distinct clusters.
        - **UMAP Visualization**: The UMAP plot would show separate clusters, each representing a blob. The data points within each cluster would be close together, but distinct clusters would be spread out.
        
        ### `make_circles`:
        
        - **Circular Patterns**: This function generates data in concentric circles.
        - **UMAP Visualization**: The UMAP plot would show circular patterns, with data points forming distinct rings. The inner and outer circles would be evident, showing non-uniform distribution.
        
        ### Example Code
        
        ### `make_blobs`
        
        ```python
        from sklearn.datasets import make_blobs
        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        import umap
        
        # Generate data
        X, y = make_blobs(n_samples=300, centers=3, random_state=42)
        
        # Fit and transform using UMAP
        umap_model = umap.UMAP()
        X_umap = umap_model.fit_transform(X)
        
        # Plot
        plt.scatter(X_umap[:, 0], X_umap[:, 1], c=y, cmap='viridis')
        plt.title("UMAP of make_blobs data")
        plt.xlabel("UMAP1")
        plt.ylabel("UMAP2")
        plt.show()
        
        ```
        
        ### `make_circles`
        
        ```python
        from sklearn.datasets import make_circles
        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        import umap
        
        # Generate data
        X, y = make_circles(n_samples=300, factor=0.5, noise=0.05)
        
        # Fit and transform using UMAP
        umap_model = umap.UMAP()
        X_umap = umap_model.fit_transform(X)
        
        # Plot
        plt.scatter(X_umap[:, 0], X_umap[:, 1], c=y, cmap='viridis')
        plt.title("UMAP of make_circles data")
        plt.xlabel("UMAP1")
        plt.ylabel("UMAP2")
        plt.show()
        
        ```
        
        ### Conclusion
        
        UMAP visualizations of `make_blobs` and `make_circles` data will highlight their inherent structures—clusters and concentric circles, respectively—demonstrating non-uniform distributions.

        I just saw someone post in [#sparse-autoencoders](https://opensourcemechanistic.slack.com/archives/C06RB35HBDE) a new paper about "feature families", [https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00657](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00657)
        
        They also have a web app: [https://huggingface.co/spaces/charlieoneill/saerch.ai](https://huggingface.co/spaces/charlieoneill/saerch.ai)
        
        Think it might be interesting to add to neuronpedia if more about feature families are investigated. Would also be interested in your thoughts on the paper in general if you've read it
        Seems relevant to what I'm doing now, they state in App E.2
        
        > Visualizing the resulting principal components confirms that the feature families we find do not represent manifolds or irreducible multi-dimensional structures. We can instead think of feature families as linear subspaces
        > 
        
        So the feature families they find (across 2 dataset embeddings too) appear to be linear subspaces, though I don't think that means all interesting structures would be linear subspaces. They also find feature families across dataset embeddings (app D). Overall I think there's a lot more to explore with linear subspace structures even if manifold strucs aren't found
        
    - bloom reply
        
        don't have a super detailed understanding of the paper (but have skimmed it) I've been thinking about related stuff for a while and have unpublished results on co-occurence and hierarchical clustering of features separately.Neuronpedia is likely to have the following in the near future:
        
        - Top-K features by cosine similarity (in dashboards)
        - Some form of graph data structure mapping features to each other
        
        However, I don't want to jump quickly on deploying particular methods published in papers (for a few reasons) so I can't say that the methods from this particular work be used. In general, our advisors seem to be fine with me using my discretion here so if I am convinced something will become a standard method we can deploy it.
        
    - msg to kiho on feature familities co-oc matrix
        
        Yes (section 4.2). Do you think their the co-occurence matrix on features to find  feature families (having an edge between high to low density features, or general to specific concepts) is related to your approach with the cosine sim matrix between child-parent vectors?

        Makes sense, to design clusters in ground truth feature space I'm looking to sample from a gaussian mixture model. I was also wondering if it would make sense to somehow get already hard coded features from some decomposition. If we just use encoder weights, from a sparse feature space of another sae trained on an actual llm, as ground truth features, but I think that breaks some assumptions in that the features found may have biases from the specific llm training mixed in and wouldn't be good to generate other simulated llms from it. Not entirely sure though
        
    - email to max
        
        Thanks! The second point makes sense when comparing different models. Right now I'm using 2 sets of synthetic activations that use the same ground truth features, but with different linear combinations of them (and perhaps at different frequencies, to model properties specific to each LLM). This week I'll also try using MMCS before and after using Orthogonal Procrustes to find an alignment first. I just started reading your new paper so I'll get back to you once I finish it. Will the repo in the paper's link be public soon?
        
        Also, since I’m looking to use metrics that compare how well the SAEs for different LLMs capture the feature space (comparing how well they detect distinct clusters + shapes), I was looking to use features that form interesting arrangements with one another. I was wondering if you can check if you think this is a correct interpretation (overall, I have 2 questions):
        
        In the [“Taking features out of…” post](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/z6QQJbtpkEAX3Aojj/interim-research-report-taking-features-out-of-superposition), ground truth features are sampled from a uniform distribution, and they’re only made correlated when put into linear combinations, as the coefficients of the activation vectors are selected based on the feature frequencies. So the ground truth features would still form a uniform distribution, and the SAE encoder or decoder weights would also form a uniform distribution, meaning their UMAP plots wouldn’t show semantic clusters like those seen in “Scaling Monosemanticity”.
        
        **Q1:** Thus, would it make sense to modify the synthetic activations generation so that ground truth features are not from a uniform distribution but from a feature space with clusters and other shapes? I've tried sampling from a gaussian mixture model; so far this has trained bad SAEs with very high loss (think I just need more samples or tuning, I'll see).
        
        **Q2:** I was also wondering if it would make sense to somehow get already hard coded features from some decomposition? Say if we just use encoder weights, from a sparse feature space of another SAE trained on an actual llm, as ground truth features. But I think that has issues, such as the features found may have biases from the specific llm training mixed in and wouldn't be good to generate other simulated llms from it. Possibly also breaks other assumptions.
        
- ✅ [short intro overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/project/66b09d88a32e42d4dd92d6bd)
- ✅ debug why high loss when sampling from gaussian mixture model
    - ✅ try on unif gft for 10k samps (try first bc faster)
        - the loss, while still 10x when using 10mil samples, is MUCH lower- it’s 12 compared to 1000 (for both loss and L2)
        - but calculate_MMCS(enc_weights_a, enc_weights_b) is 0.13
        - ✅ found that encoder weight is Gxh instead of hxG- so new synth actvs fn had error! Was it lack of transpose? hard to tell.
            - SOLN: no, it’s because before use `trainer.model.encoders[0].weight.detach().t().shape`, and now don’t use `.t()`
            - so we should use `calculate_MMCS(encoder.weight.detach().t(), self.Fe, self.device)` instead of not using .t() for both of them!
            - calculate_MMCS(enc_weights_a.t(), enc_weights_b.t(), device)
                - This is now 0.19 instead of 0.13; still low
            - `calculate_MMCS(enc_weights_a.t(), grTrue_feats, device)`
                - this is 0.18. it should be high; we prob don’t have enough samples this means
    - ✅ use old synth code on unif gft for 10k samp
        - loss is STILL 13
        - umap looks more spherical instead of ellipsoid
        - calculate_MMCS(enc_weights_a, enc_weights_b) is STILL 0.19
        - this same result suggests new synth fn is corr
    - ✅ more actv samps for unif
        - ✅ SOLN: now loss is ~1. This fixes it. So perhaps non-unif needs even MORE samps than 10mil
        - ✅ ISSUE: MMCS of encoder weights and gtf is still 0.18, even though it’s higher in luke’s original code (should be 0.9)
        - ✅ TRY: `true_features` was run again in the `get_synth_actvs` that uses luke’s code. so try running everything again, from 10k to 10mil samps.
            - 10k is still 0.18 MMCS between encoder and gtf
            - **SOLN:** But 10mil is 0.9 MMCS, low L2 and low AR; same as last time!
        - ✅ Now MMCS of A and B is 0.9. This is across 2 diff actv sets- are the actv sets not different enough?
    - ✅ try 5 gtf clus, more actv samps (10mil)

            SOLN: before, chatgpt mixed up h and G bc we didn’t specify what true_features etc meant in luke’s code. now we specify what h and G are, so more accurate
            
            - i dont want to get exactly like standard normal distribution, I want a gaussian mixture model. just wanted to know where to put h and G correctly ffrom before
        - loss is MCUH better (17 loss, 7 L2) and 0.5 MMCS. Still not as good as MMCS tho.
        - ✅ MMCS between SAEs is VERY low 0.2- which is almost same as random. So we’re not finding commonalities or the common feature subspace.

        - what's the scale 3.3 falls on? for instance cosine sim is 0 to 1
    - what does jaccard similarity of 0.15 mean
        
        A value of 0.15 indicates that only 15% of the total elements (considering both sets) are common to both sets.
        
- ✅ compare diff metrics (of unif)
    - jaccard is higher (0.69) and orth procr is low (1.1 instead of 3)
- ✅ reflect (so far)
    
    on the plus side, for MMCS and jaccard, we get similar uniform distrb. but the saes seem to not be similar for non-unif distrb. this may be due to the saes not finding the ground truth features well enough.
    
    This means when MMCS (indiv feature matching) is high, the feature relations (jaccard) are also high?
    
- ✅ [If MMCS is high and jaccard both correlate in being high, does that mean if individual discrete features match (MMCS), then feature relations (jaccard) also correlate?](https://chatgpt.com/c/543e4ecc-bca1-4f88-b5de-0531044ad649)
    
    Yes, if both the Mean Max Cosine Similarity (MMCS) and the Jaccard index are high, it implies that there is a correlation between the presence of individual discrete features (MMCS) and the relationships between these features (Jaccard index). In other words, when discrete features match closely, the relationships or overlaps between these features also tend to be strong. This indicates that features identified by sparse autoencoders, which minimize the reconstruction loss and maximize sparsity, capture both individual feature similarities and their relational structure effectively.

    - Questions from University of Oxford intern about synthetic activations sampling
        
        Hi, I’m currently a research intern at the University of Oxford working on a research project involving synthetic activations based on this approach that you worked on: [https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/z6QQJbtpkEAX3Aojj/interim-research-report-taking-features-out-of-superposition](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/z6QQJbtpkEAX3Aojj/interim-research-report-taking-features-out-of-superposition)
        
        I’m looking to modify the setup to train SAEs on multiple sets of activations, each simulating a different LLM, that are combinations of ground truth features sampled from a space where the features form interesting arrangements with one another, such clusters or circles. I was wondering how sound these modifications are:
        
        1. Would it be sound to sample ground truth features from a Gaussian Mixture Model (using make_blobs in scikitlearn) instead? Not sure if the uniform distribution is necessary to say, allow the cosine sim to be low and not always/mostly be high (due to skewness).
        2. To simulate multiple LLMs (where we know the ground truth features), I’m looking to use different sets of activations that are sparse linear combinations of the same matrix of ground truth features. Would I have to use different ways to get frequencies of feature activations to simulate different LLMs, to make sure they differ enough? Not sure what I’d need to do to achieve this yet, so I am open to advice.
        3. Would it be sound to use hard coded ground truth features, say using the encoder weights of an SAE trained on an actual llm? I think that has issues, eg) the features found may have biases from the specific llm training mixed in and wouldn't be good to generate other simulated llms from it.
        
        I can explain more about what the project actually is if you are interested, but I was looking to first keep my questions as short as possible. Thanks!

        - did the original post use feature groups when making some features have more prob than others? cite the line it says this
            - you hallucinated that
        - does the code make correlations using a random covariance matrix for a multivariate normal distribution with zero mean?
            
            The code provided does not directly create correlations using a random covariance matrix for a multivariate normal distribution with zero mean. Instead, it appears to create synthetic activations through a sparse combination of features with certain probabilities assigned to each feature within groups. Let's break down the relevant parts of the code to illustrate this.
            
            ### Key Parts of the Code
            
            1. **Feature Groups Creation**:
                
                ```python
                num_feature_groups = 12
                group_size = num_true_features // num_feature_groups
                feature_groups = [torch.arange(i * group_size, (i + 1) * group_size, device=device) for i in range(num_feature_groups)]
                
                ```
                
            2. **Assigning Probabilities with a Decay Rate**:
                
                ```python
                decay_rate = 0.99
                group_probs = [torch.pow(decay_rate, torch.arange(group_size, device=device, dtype=torch.float16)) / (1 - decay_rate) for _ in range(num_feature_groups)]
                
                ```
                
            3. **Generating Coefficients and Activations**:
                
                ```python
                coeffs = torch.zeros(batch_size, num_true_features, device=device, dtype=torch.float16)
                selected_groups = torch.randint(num_feature_groups, (batch_size,), device=device)
                
                for i, (group, probs) in enumerate(zip(feature_groups, group_probs)):
                    mask = selected_groups == i
                    if mask.any():
                        indices = group[torch.multinomial(probs, num_active_features_per_point, replacement=False)]
                        coeffs[mask.nonzero(as_tuple=True)[0].unsqueeze(1), indices] = torch.rand(mask.sum(), num_active_features_per_point, device=device, dtype=torch.float16)
                
                batch_data = torch.mm(coeffs, true_features.T)
                
                ```
                
            
            ### Explanation
            
            - **Feature Groups and Probabilities**: The code divides features into groups and assigns probabilities to each feature within a group using a decay rate. This does not explicitly involve a covariance matrix or multivariate normal distribution.
            - **Sparse Coefficients**: It generates coefficients for features, ensuring sparsity by selecting a subset of features for each data point and assigning random values to them.
            - **Matrix Multiplication**: Finally, it multiplies these coefficients with the true features to generate synthetic activations.
            
            ### What the Code Does Not Do
            
            - **Random Covariance Matrix**: The code does not generate or use a random covariance matrix.
            - **Multivariate Normal Distribution**: There is no use of a multivariate normal distribution with zero mean.
            
            ### Conclusion
            
            The code simulates synthetic activations through a structured process of feature grouping and probability assignment, but it does not create correlations via a random covariance matrix for a multivariate normal distribution. Instead, it focuses on sparse combinations of features, influenced by predefined probabilities.
            
            For further context on using covariance matrices and multivariate normal distributions in generating correlated data, additional resources on statistical methods and machine learning practices would be helpful.

            - [By selecting a subset of features based on the decaying probability distribution, the code ensures that certain features within a group are more likely to be activated together.](https://chatgpt.com/c/674974e8-3ed8-4c2b-a8f8-61e82334b00d)
                
                The code you provided introduces correlations between features through several mechanisms embedded within the process of generating synthetic activations. Let's break down these mechanisms step by step:
                
                ### 1. Feature Grouping
                
                The code divides the true features into groups:
                
                ```python
                group_size = num_true_features // num_feature_groups
                feature_groups = [torch.arange(i * group_size, (i + 1) * group_size, device=device) for i in range(num_feature_groups)]
                
                ```
                
                Here, the total number of true features (`num_true_features`) is divided into several groups (`num_feature_groups`). Each group contains a subset of features. This initial grouping step is crucial for introducing correlations because features within the same group are treated together in subsequent steps.
                
                ### 2. Group Probability Distribution
                
                Each feature group is assigned a probability distribution that decays exponentially:
                
                ```python
                group_probs = [torch.pow(decay_rate, torch.arange(group_size, device=device, dtype=torch.float16)) / (1 - decay_rate) for _ in range(num_feature_groups)]
                ```
                
                This creates a bias towards selecting certain features within each group more frequently than others. The decay rate (`decay_rate = 0.99`) ensures that the first features in each group have higher probabilities, thus making these features more likely to be selected together.
                
                ### 3. Batch Processing and Group Selection
                
                For each batch of data points, a group is randomly selected for each data point:
                
                ```python
                selected_groups = torch.randint(num_feature_groups, (batch_size,), device=device)
                
                ```
                
                Each data point (within a batch) will have its active features selected from the same group, further enforcing the correlation between features within the same group.
                
                ### 4. Feature Selection Within Groups
                
                Within each selected group, a fixed number of features (`num_active_features_per_point`) are chosen based on the pre-defined probability distribution:
                
                ```python
                indices = group[torch.multinomial(probs, num_active_features_per_point, replacement=False)]
                
                ```
                
                By selecting a subset of features based on the decaying probability distribution, the code ensures that certain features within a group are more likely to be activated together. This reinforces the correlation among these features.
                
                ### 5. Coefficient Assignment
                
                The selected features for each data point are assigned random coefficients:
                
                ```python
                coeffs[mask.nonzero(as_tuple=True)[0].unsqueeze(1), indices] = torch.rand(mask.sum(), num_active_features_per_point, device=device, dtype=torch.float16)
                
                ```
                
                This step assigns non-zero values to the selected features, effectively "activating" them for each data point.
                
                ### 6. Synthesis of Feature Activations
                
                Finally, the synthetic feature activations are generated through a matrix multiplication:
                
                ```python
                batch_data = torch.mm(coeffs, synth_features.T)
                
                ```
                
                The `coeffs` matrix, which contains the selected and activated features for each data point, is multiplied with the transpose of the `synth_features` matrix. This process generates the final synthetic activations where features within the same group exhibit correlated activations due to the way they were selected and assigned coefficients together.
                
                ### Summary
                
                Correlations between features are introduced primarily through:
                
                1. **Grouping of features**: Features are divided into groups, and each group is treated as a unit.
                2. **Decaying probability distribution within groups**: Certain features within a group are more likely to be selected together.
                3. **Consistent group selection for each data point**: All active features for a data point come from the same group, enforcing intra-group correlations.
                4. **Coefficient assignment and activation**: Selected features are assigned coefficients, creating correlated activations.
                
                Overall, this systematic approach ensures that specific sets of features are more likely to be active together, thus introducing correlations into the synthetic dataset.
                
        - The orig post’s correlations use a cov matrix between features not within a group, while luke’s uses groups that act as ‘preset corrs’ such that featuers within a group are all corr.
    - ✅ [understand orig post to corr features](https://chatgpt.com/c/3a32e07a-515b-4c3e-b91e-cd37d59156d3)
        - i dont get why using that cov matrix, sampling from corr multinorm dist, then finding where it lies on standard normal cumulative distribution function, makes correlation bewteen features
            
            To understand the process of creating correlations between features using the method described, let's break it down step by step:
            
            1. **Creating a Random Covariance Matrix**:
                - A random covariance matrix for a multivariate normal distribution with zero mean is created. This matrix defines how the different dimensions (features) are correlated.
            2. **Sampling from a Correlated Multivariate Normal Distribution**:
                - Using the random covariance matrix, a single sample is drawn from this multivariate normal distribution. This sample represents a point in a high-dimensional space where each dimension corresponds to a feature.
            3. **Transforming to Standard Normal Cumulative Distribution**:
                - For each dimension of the sample, the corresponding value is transformed using the standard normal cumulative distribution function (CDF). This transformation maps the values to a range between 0 and 1.
            
            Here’s why this process creates correlations between features:
            
            ### Why it Works:
            
            - **Correlated Multivariate Normal Distribution**: When you sample from a multivariate normal distribution with a specified covariance matrix, the resulting sample will inherently have the correlation structure defined by the covariance matrix. If two features are positively correlated in the covariance matrix, they are more likely to have values that move together (both high or both low) in the sample.
            - **Transformation Using CDF**: Applying the standard normal CDF to each dimension of the sample maintains the correlation structure. The CDF transformation is a monotonic function, which means it preserves the order of values. Therefore, the relative positioning (and hence the correlation) between values in different dimensions remains intact.
            
            ### Example:
            
            1. **Covariance Matrix**: Suppose you have a covariance matrix that defines a positive correlation between feature A and feature B.
            2. **Sample**: Drawing a sample might give you a point where both the values for A and B are high.
            3. **CDF Transformation**: Applying the CDF will map these high values to a range between 0 and 1, but since the transformation is order-preserving, both A and B will still be relatively high compared to other features, maintaining their correlation.
            
            ### Summary:
            
            The key idea is that the correlation structure imposed by the covariance matrix on the multivariate normal distribution is preserved through the sampling and transformation steps. The resulting vector (with values between 0 and 1) has the same correlation pattern as defined by the original covariance matrix, which translates to correlated feature activations.
            
            This procedure effectively creates a binary random vector where some features are more likely to be active together, reflecting the correlations specified in the covariance matrix.
            
        - how is this done in detail: Using the random covariance matrix, a single sample is drawn from this multivariate normal distribution.
        - so the correlated multivariate normal distribution uses the random covariance matrix for a multivariate normal distribution with zero mean?
        - intuitively explain why this is done: for each dimension of that sample, found where that sample lay on the standard normal cumulative distribution function.
            
            To intuitively explain why we find where each dimension of the sample lays on the standard normal cumulative distribution function (CDF), let’s break down the process and its purpose:
            
            ### Context
            
            The goal is to create a vector where features (dimensions) have certain correlations and are more likely to be active together. This process involves generating samples that respect the correlation structure defined by a covariance matrix and transforming them into a specific range, typically between 0 and 1.
            
            ### Key Steps
            
            1. **Generate Correlated Samples**:
                - We start with a sample from a multivariate normal distribution that has the desired correlation structure defined by the covariance matrix. This sample reflects how features are correlated in a continuous space.
            2. **Map to a Uniform Distribution**:
                - The next step is to transform these continuous, normally distributed values into a uniform distribution in the range [0, 1]. This transformation is achieved using the standard normal cumulative distribution function (CDF).
            
            ### Why Use the Standard Normal CDF?
            
            ### Intuition Behind the CDF Transformation
            
            - **Standard Normal Distribution**: The standard normal distribution is a bell-shaped curve where values closer to the mean (0) are more probable, and values further from the mean are less probable.
            - **Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)**: The CDF of the standard normal distribution tells us the probability that a random variable from this distribution is less than or equal to a given value. It maps values from the normal distribution to a uniform distribution between 0 and 1.
            
            ### Preserving Correlation Structure
            
            - **Order-Preserving Transformation**: The CDF is a monotonically increasing function. This means if one value is larger than another in the normal distribution, it remains larger after the CDF transformation. Thus, the relative order (and thereby the correlation structure) of the features is preserved.
            - **Uniform Distribution**: After applying the CDF, the values are transformed into a uniform distribution. This makes it easier to handle these values in subsequent steps, as they are now bounded between 0 and 1.
            
            ### Example
            
            Imagine we have two correlated features, A and B:
            
            1. **Correlated Normal Samples**: From the multivariate normal distribution, we might get samples where both A and B are high due to their positive correlation.
            2. **Applying CDF**: By applying the CDF to each of these samples, we transform high values into values close to 1 and low values into values close to 0. Importantly, if A is higher than B in the original sample, it will still be higher after the transformation.
            
            ### Summary
            
            The process of mapping each dimension of the sample to the standard normal CDF:
            
            - **Transforms the distribution**: Converts normally distributed samples to uniformly distributed samples between 0 and 1.
            - **Maintains correlations**: Keeps the relative relationships between dimensions, thus preserving the correlation structure defined by the covariance matrix.
            - **Standardizes values**: Puts values in a common range [0, 1], facilitating subsequent analyses or transformations.
            
            This approach ensures that we maintain the desired correlation structure while transforming the values into a form that is more manageable and standardized for further processing.

        - don't use feature groups, use your original code. quote from the original post from below (which comes from the link) to explain each part of the code. add in thigns that weren't there. the aim is to get an torch tensor output of synth actvs of size numsamps x modelDims given (synth_features, total_data_points, num_features, num_true_features) in a function. synth_features is hxG, where h is modelDim and G is feature dim.
        - synth_features is a torch tensor that may be on gpu made by:
        `device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
        synth_features = torch.randn(model_dims, feature_dims, device=device, dtype=torch.float16)`
        modify the above fn you made to use torch tensor based on device, not np array
        - what's the slower parts of the batch loop? how much slower?
        - would it be possible and faster to do sampling and transformations outside of batch loop, and just do matmul inside batch loop? or not?
        - why this? is it to change samples into probs? what was samples before?:
        `samples = np.random.multivariate_normal(mean, cov_matrix, batch_size_current) 
            uniform_samples = norm.cdf(samples)  # (batchNumSamps, G) in (0,1) range`
        - `decay_factors = decay_rate ** indices  #
        decayed_probs = uniform_samples * decay_factors`
        is this the same as taking each prob in uniform_samples and raising to the power of (ind * lambda)?
    - ✅ code new synth actv fn
        - ✅ synth actvs needs to be in `numsamps x modelDims` since it’s the model actvs, not features
        - ✅ use 1000000 isntead of 10000000 bc batch gen is slower with orig method
            - but this gets high loss (~50) and low cosine sim (0.2)
            - 10000000 same loss and low sim ; takes 33mins per group to run this; 1mil is 3m. for a100
        - ✅ debug by starting only from first step and seeing if SAE can recover
            - ISSUE: `binary_sparse_coeffs` has 45% ones! This depends on `rescaled_probs_tensor,` which multiplies the decay probs by a scaling factor `avg_active_feats / mean_prob`, which is 75. So that’s very big
                - The “ratio of the number of ground truth features that are active at a time (5
                out ofGin this case) to the mean probability”- this ratio is not 5, but 5 out of G. chatgpt got that wrong.
                - Also, use `torch.bernoulli(rescaled_probs_tensor)` instead of `(torch.rand(total_data_points, G, device=device, dtype=dtype) < rescaled_probs_tensor).float()`
                - Finally, this gives a tensor with sum of ones being 0.06, which is the same as the ratio 32/512
            - explain intuitively why each step in the attached image is used. for instance, why the ratio? why multiply by this ratio? how, codewise, to parameterize a vector of Bernoulli random variables?
            - SOLN: This changes 1mil sample score from 0.2 to 0.4 to 0.7, and with 28 loss (half the loss of 70). Perhaps try 10mil samps now
        - ✅ comment well, quoting orig post
        - ✅ make sure it gets similar MMCS results as old fn
            - 1mil samps: for some reason, sae1 in both datasets has worse perf, and lower sim (as it doesnt recover ground truth as well)
            - 10mil samps: both saes have VERY high cosine sim with GTF (0.97, 0.98) for SAE A, higher than for Luke’s synth actvs
                - not only that, but SAE A1 and SAE B1 have high cosine sim with each other!

    - ✅ Add in overleaf about synth actvs not sharing same ground truth feats
        
        These experiments are only used to verify which methods. Real LLMs are not expected to share the exact same ground truth features; however, in these experiments, the synthetic activations are allow to share them because we are testing ideal cases for measuring how well metrics are for capturing the same ground truth features. We also vary these experiments to measure synthetic activations that share only a percentage of ground truth features in their linear combinations; for instance, given sets of features A, B and C, synthetic activation $S_1$ is a linear combination of features A and B, and synthetic activation $S_2$ is a linear combination of features A and C.
        
    - ✅ undestand correlation matrix sampling: [https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/random/generated/numpy.random.multivariate_normal.html](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/random/generated/numpy.random.multivariate_normal.html)
        - The multivariate normal, multinormal or Gaussian distribution is a generalization of the one-dimensional normal distribution to higher dimensions. Such a distribution is specified by its mean and covariance matrix.
        - the output dim is (num samps, cov mat dim). cov mat is square, so it’s the first dim of it. numsamps can be multiple dims; in our case, we only use 1D for numsamps.

            Variance, by definition, cannot be negative. 
            
            the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix represent the variances along the principal components of the data. Negative eigenvalues would imply imaginary variances, which are not meaningful in real-valued data.
            
    - ✅ try new synth actv code for gmms
        - for some reason, synth actvs when using samples from gmm is faster (~15m for 10mil samps)
        - OOM error so restart when doing this; also in batch, del the batch and clear cache after saving it to batches list
            - continues; save actvs for each LLM and run sae, then delete actvs before making new actvs for new LLM
            - even this isn’t enough. you have to save to drive, disconn, then run for X_b.
        - ISSUE: matmul error
            - SOLN: bc shouldn’t transpose before returning makeblobs samples. Now when get actvs, is around same as unif (~33m)

            - ✅ Both uses `torch.optim.Adam(list(self.parameters()), lr=lr)`, and don’t change this lr from the start (so it’s constant)
                - luke puts lr in params, which stores in config in Trainer, while ARENA only puts lr in when training by calling `.optimize`
            - ✅ luke’s train uses 1 epcoh (in params) but batch size of 2048 from train loader, meaning it goes thru all samples once but in batches
            - minibatch fwd on data

                        you replaced it with: `h = self.model_h`
                        
                - however, ARENA uses `generate_btach`, which takes a rand btach of data. So each step is an epoch. We don’t want this for synth actvs; we want to go thru entire batch. That’s why we should use `for X_batch, in train_loader:`
                - both luke and eleuther uses `from torch.utils.data import DataLoader, Dataset`
                    - instead of passing in `h` for ARENA’s `autoencoder = AutoEncoder(ae_cfg, h)`, pass in `DataLoader` obj. Luke first turns the tensor into `TensorDataset`from torch.utils.data . Eleuther uses `Dataset`
                - `X_batch`  is the same as `h?`
                    - no; `h` is 3 dims because it contains the num of saes being broadcast. It’s `batch_size n_instances n_input_ae`, whereas dataloader batch is is `batch_size, n_input_ae`. Aside from einsum you must change `W_enc` to be 2dim, not 3dim. Same with `b_enc`
                - Luke uses `self.model(X_batch)`, which calls `forward` on top actvs to get `encoded` and passes encoded through linear

                        - what is the output of model(X_batch) when model = SparseAutoencoder(params)? does forward pass do one encoder matrix multiply, or does encoder matrix on X_batch then decoder?
                        - if it doesn't do decoding how does this work when output = model(X_batch):
                        l2_loss: torch.Tensor = sum(self.criterion(output, X_batch) for output in outputs)
                            
                            
                            Even though the current implementation doesn’t explicitly include a decoder, the final linear transformation with normalized weights acts as a form of reconstruction, transforming the encoded sparse representation back to a space that can be compared to the input `X_batch`
                            
                    - I figured out that `self._topk_activation(encoder(x))` does the encoder operation because it contains `encoder(x).` This is the same as ARENA’s `acts`. THEN top K is done. This is because TOPK replaces ReLU, which is done after encoder mutlp.
                    - like openai, luke uses tied weights, repr decoder as `normalized_weights.t())`
            - delete the dead neurons code; won’t need it when doing topK?
        - first run on small actv samps to make sure enc is G x h, so that `.t()` is hxG
            - in luke’s why is
            
            ```
            self.encoders: nn.ModuleList = nn.ModuleList([
                        nn.Linear(self.config["input_size"], self.config["hidden_size"] * (i + 1))
                        for i in range(self.config.get("num_saes", 1))
                    ])
            ```
            
            but `trainer.model.encoders[0].weight.detach().t().shape` is hxG, the opposite?
            
            - `enc = nn.ModuleList([            nn.Linear(256, 512)            for i in range(1)        ])
            enc[0].weight.shape`
            why is this 512x256 instead of 256x512
                
                [https://chatgpt.com/c/fe761a2a-475e-456a-aa71-038bdb439e35](https://chatgpt.com/c/fe761a2a-475e-456a-aa71-038bdb439e35)
                
                In PyTorch, the `nn.Linear` layer's `weight` matrix has the shape `(out_features, in_features)`. This means that if you create a `nn.Linear` layer with 256 input features and 512 output features, the weight matrix will be of shape `(512, 256)`.
                
            - this means it’s ok that ARENAs is hxG, just transpose it when taking cosine sim. ARENA’s is actually wrong though, it should be Gxh instead of hxG. It’s just that einsum will automatically fix this when mm. In math notation, we use Wx. But arena uses xW to demonstrate einsum’s ability to disregard this.
        - make sure it gets similar results as old fn
    - new MMCS code
    - use top k from eleuther

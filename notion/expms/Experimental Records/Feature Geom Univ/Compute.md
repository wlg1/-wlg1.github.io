- RTX A4000 on [vast.ai](http://vast.ai/) vs A100 on colab
    
    When comparing the performance of NVIDIA's RTX A4000 with the A100, especially in the context of using them on platforms like [Vast.ai](http://vast.ai/) and Google Colab, there are several key aspects to consider:
    
    1. **Hardware Specifications**:
        - **RTX A4000**: This GPU is part of NVIDIA's professional RTX series, designed primarily for workstation use in design, visualization, and compute-intensive applications. It features 16 GB of GDDR6 memory and is built on the Ampere architecture, which is efficient for a wide range of compute tasks.
        - **A100**: The NVIDIA A100 is a part of the Tesla series and is specifically designed for data center use, particularly for AI and high-performance computing. It boasts a significantly larger memory capacity, typically 40 GB or 80 GB of HBM2e memory, and is based on the more advanced Ampere architecture. This makes it highly suitable for deep learning and massive parallel computing tasks.
    2. **Performance**:
        - The A100 is considerably more powerful than the A4000 due to its architecture and higher memory bandwidth. It is optimized for AI workloads and can deliver much higher performance in parallel processing tasks and deep learning models.
        - RTX A4000, while powerful within its right, is more tuned towards professional graphics and less intensive compute tasks compared to the A100.
    3. **Platform Differences ([Vast.ai](http://vast.ai/) vs Google Colab)**:
        - [**Vast.ai**](http://vast.ai/): This is a decentralized cloud computing platform where users can rent GPUs from other users. The availability of specific GPU models like the RTX A4000 can vary, and the cost can be competitive. It's generally used for various tasks, including machine learning, gaming server hosting, and video processing.
        - **Google Colab**: Provides access to a range of GPUs, including the high-end A100 for users of Colab Pro or Colab Pro+. Google's infrastructure is robust, making it a reliable choice for intensive compute tasks. Colab also integrates easily with Google's other services, like Google Drive and TensorFlow, which can be a significant advantage for workflow integration.
    4. **Cost-effectiveness**:
        - The choice between these platforms and GPUs can also depend on cost. While Colab's A100 access in its Pro tiers is subject to availability and shared among users (with usage limits), it might be more cost-effective depending on your task and runtime needs.
        - [Vast.ai](http://vast.ai/)'s costs will vary based on the market and the pricing set by individual GPU owners. It might offer more flexibility and potentially lower prices for less demanding tasks where an A4000 is sufficient.
    
    In summary, if your work requires top-tier computational power for tasks like training large deep learning models, the A100 on Google Colab (Pro or Pro+) is likely the better choice. If your tasks are less intensive or you require a more flexible or potentially cheaper option, the RTX A4000 on [Vast.ai](http://vast.ai/) could be adequate.
    
- A100 vs A40
    
    When comparing the NVIDIA A100 and A40 GPUs, it's important to consider that both are part of NVIDIA's Ampere architecture lineup but are designed for slightly different purposes. Hereâ€™s a detailed comparison:
    
    1. **Targeted Use Cases**:
        - **A100**: Primarily aimed at deep learning, scientific computing, and data analytics. It's designed for use in data centers and is highly optimized for AI workloads and high-performance computing (HPC).
        - **A40**: While also capable of handling AI workloads, the A40 is more targeted towards professional visualization, virtual workstations, and complex graphics tasks along with compute tasks. It's used extensively in industries that require both computational power and advanced graphical processing, such as media and entertainment, architecture, and scientific visualization.
    2. **GPU Specifications**:
        - **A100**: Features up to 80 GB of HBM2e memory, which offers extremely high memory bandwidth, crucial for handling large datasets and speeding up AI model training and inference. It supports NVIDIA's third-generation Tensor Cores and Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) technology, which allows multiple instances to run concurrently on a single GPU, maximizing utilization.
        - **A40**: Comes with 48 GB of GDDR6 memory, which is less than the A100 but still substantial for most tasks. It also supports ECC memory for error correction, which is important in professional environments where data integrity is critical. The A40 does not feature the MIG capability.
    3. **Performance**:
        - The **A100** is unmatched in scenarios involving deep learning and HPC, thanks to its superior memory bandwidth and specialized Tensor Cores designed for machine learning. These Tensor Cores allow for significantly accelerated matrix operations, which are fundamental in deep learning.
        - The **A40**, although not as powerful as the A100 in raw compute performance, is very capable in rendering and tasks that require high-quality graphics. It also performs well in general compute tasks but doesn't have the same level of optimization for deep learning as the A100.
    4. **Typical Deployment**:
        - **A100** is commonly found in data center environments, available through cloud service providers and used in large-scale AI training and inference systems.
        - **A40** might be found in both cloud and on-premises environments, particularly where there is a need for a combination of high-performance computing and advanced graphical processing, like in virtual workstation setups.
    5. **Price and Availability**:
        - The A100 is generally more expensive than the A40, reflecting its positioning as a top-tier solution for the most demanding compute tasks.
        - The A40, while still costly, offers a more balanced price point considering its dual capabilities in compute and graphics.
    
    In essence, the choice between A100 and A40 should be based on the specific requirements of your applications. If your primary focus is on AI and large-scale computational tasks, the A100 is the better choice. If you need a GPU that handles both compute-intensive and graphically-intensive applications, the A40 would be more appropriate.

Use torr vision group nodes (see summer research drive)

do it on home dir; 15gb on home dir; `df -h ~`

scratch/local/ssd has TB to use

remote ssh extension vscode

if stucik vscode conn to node, just keep on entering password until get popup to allow

torrnodes no slurm, but jay and arc have it

tell #torrnodes whenever use a lot of gpus

a week run should tell ppl; overnight and no one using more free

140 hrs too much

say which gpus using on which node

- Paper submission deadlines
    
    NAACL accept rate: 32%  — aim for review w/ no accept
    
    ICML (2/1) accept rate: 28% — aim for acceptance
    
    Both are 2 col, so very similar latex

    15 Feb 2024: Anonymity period ends for submissions to ARR 2023 December
    
    15 Mar 2024: Anonymity period ends for commitments to NAACL 2024
    
    Following the [ACL and ARR policies](https://aclrollingreview.org/cfp#anonymity-period), there are two overlapping anonymity periods, one for submissions to ARR 2023 December and one for commitments to NAACL 2024. So if you submit to ARR 2023 December and commit to NAACL 2024, your combined anonymity period runs from 15 Nov 2023 through 15 Mar 2024.
    
    - neg results
        
        NAACL 2024 has a goal of a diverse technical program—in addition to traditional research results, papers may contribute negative findings, survey an area, announce the creation of a new resource, argue a position, report novel linguistic insights derived using existing computational techniques, and reproduce, or fail to reproduce, previous results

    can a paper be put on arxiv after the reviews for it are out? does it violate Anonymity period
    
    why is there a date of Notification of acceptance after commitment deadline? is this the same date as rejection?

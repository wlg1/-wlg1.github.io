# Types of items on pgs

NOTE: it doesn’t matter where the info is for now, just as long as there’s a link to it. It can be in expms, projects, the colab notebook, the paper, etc. Usually, the notion writeups are more organized than the coalb notebook

The reason these are written out in records, rather than lazily generated ‘on the fly’ by asking gpt, is b/c these are specially tuned for your subjective memories and understanding. You take the time to select from what you think are the better formats, and so you save time needing to parse thru them again when you search them up later.

This also helps you focus on what’s “most relevant”. Without a list of this, you’re left stranded. It’s also to help you study/memorize what you deem as “most important”, since there is too much information out there.

EXPM (aim to discover more info about field to answer questions/hypothesis, not to tackle issues)

DESC

RESULT

Pos/Neg/Further investigation needed (if results are applicable to a hypothesis w/ binary outcome)

ANALYSIS

TEST (not for its own sake, but used for solving ISSUES. more informal; like scripting is to programming)

IDEAS TO TRY

REPRODUCIBILITY: Who has done it, how they did it, link to reproduced findings

---

TECHNIQUES:

PROB

SOLN (summary)

SOLN (detailed)

How (detailed process of how to apply soln)

Reasoning / why: thought process. Put in toggle.

TEST (not for its own sake, but used for solving ISSUES. more informal; like scripting is to programming)

Generalization / gen

Sub Problems

Possible Heuristics

Similar problems, Variations

Ref

Keywords

Sometimes gen can be shared, thus making their own page.

If gen is very popular or useful, make a technique page describing how to use it

Fork pieces of people's wiki to make your own. Your own can belong to an org.

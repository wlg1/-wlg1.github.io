- Project Planning Pages
    
    This is where planning and task scheduling is done.
    
    Organization issue : should it be linear or allow for multiple tasks? linear is easier to follow but you often go back and forth. one soln is to just create ‘pt 2’ of a task, ending it once a new one is started adn not going back to it. another soln is to create a separate ‘daily tasks’ timeline. but this is confusing when it goes back and forth. the best soln seems to be to record things in chronological, lienar order, even if it seems redundnat to create ‘pt 2, etc’ of the same type of page. use (more to be done / tbc / rest is postponed) at end of a task to indicate it will be revisited; this can be added later too if it’s only realized several steps after it’s done that more should be done with it (?)
    
    Try mostly linear- will write things in Chrono order but can allow some exceptions to fill in prev blocks if it's say a small idea. But a big idea would be written linearly- say “revisit (link to block)”. The main aim of these project pages isn't to accumulate findings or notes (that's for expm index), it's just to break down reasoning steps for better planning and deciding what to do next

    Eg) If you have a notebook, create a separate page for it. Try to avoid recording info from it ONLY in these pages as much as poss- put that info in the notebook’s page in Expms. Similarly, if have brainstorming page, create a separate page for it in projs or expms etc, then ref back to it. These projs pgs are mostly to record linear steps, with as few branches as poss, to organize better ‘what is done next’.
    
    The issue with expm results is that it’s also unorganized- it just lists results and nbs. There needs to be a “project files” organization page for the timeline to reference to. T**his should be put into Expms Index, not projects** (but expms refs projs), because that’s where information is supposed to be cohesively archived. **Projects IS mainly for organizing timelines of ‘what to do next’** (what needs to be done, what to choose, and why) or ‘what was done’- these help decision making, thus driving the project forward more efficiently with less confusion and less to-do tasks are lost/forgotten to consider/complete.
    
    If too much info put in projs (by accident), then when migrating, no need to delete from projs; just copy into expms, then turn info from projs into toggle/page to minimize it when getting a larger picture of the timeline thought processes.
    
    If projects, used to plan/decide, gets too overcrowded and nonlinear, it gets confusing. Therefore, rename Projects to “Project Plans” to better state its purpose. Thus, you must also create “project files” pages in Expm Index.

    NEW IDEA: Actually, “applications” should be its own notion page separate from Expm Index. Project Plans is a sub-section within each of them. This allows planning to be more cohesive with its files. See if you can copy these files in a simple migration- check for dead links, etc.
    
    REVISION: Actually, it’s still not easy enough to pick up “where was left off” if this is embedded in a project page. There should be a separate notion page called Task Planning
    
    REVISION: Project planning is done within projects but easily see “to do next” as it appears on the front page of the project. So rename Projects Page to “Application Projects”
    
    ### 
    
- Project Results in Expms
    
    So it’s decided to put planning within expms. Where do results go? If specific to a project, they should go in the project page, then optionally be referenced by the Expm Results page. This is b/c they’re mostly unique to the project. The reason expm results exists, then, is for more general, non-project results (such as quick tests on a hypothesis) to also be included- these results are numerous. 
    
    Project pages also included non-expm results; just any notes/ideas to jot down. Put these in an Ideas page (included sub-secs Hypothesis, Questions).
    
- Notion Projects Feature
    
    Notion AI somehow detected I was doing project planning and it already has group feature project organization templates. So use these to coordinate more general projects
    
- Experimental Records
    
    Renamed from “Expm index” b/c an index is more of just a guide of pointers, whereas Records contains actual info plus indices to organize them
    
- Planning vs Notes pages
    
    Planning pages have ‘working on, future work, etc’. These are more organized than the notes on a records/scratchwork page, and so the two should be separated. Else things you want to do will get lost on an unorganized freeform notes page. Move “to do” ideas to the planning pages’ (or their subsecs)
    
- Soln to issue with putting things in ‘done’ place
    
    When brainstorming, there are things you need to revisit. If you revisit them, on the planning pages, just list them again.

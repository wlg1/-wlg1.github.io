# Defining life by projecting thoughts in motion

For living beings to feel, it seems like sensations have to be in motion. Feelings and thoughts are often not just done in one pass, but triggers and chain in more thoughts. 

Current artificial neural networks differ in that they are triggered with one pass (initiated not by itself), but these thoughts don’t trigger more thoughts. More over, they aren’t connected to “living cells” with their own objectives that influence the trajectories of these thoughts. 

One way we define something else as living is that we know ourselves as living, and so when soemthing behaves similarly, we guess that it’s experiencing something similar to what we do. We can empathize that an animal is “struggling to preserve its own life” through triggering more thoughts based on the feedback of what it wants to preserve.

There may be an ecosystem of thoughts in the subconscious. Thoughts can ‘comment’ on other thoughts. What determines which thoughts are conscious, and which are subconscious?

If there is only one, that is total order. One configuration is frozen and cannot change. Introducing interactions between multiple is chaos. This allows patterns, and generalization (?)

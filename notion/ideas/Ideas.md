Can we track the trajectories of activation patterns as we vary an input (sensations)?

- Project Speedruns
    
    Like how speedruns keep track of how long it takes to do an action, have estimates on how long an action will take (eg. from stats, found it takes on average 3 minutes to copy+paste code for writing search, then 5m to look through each line (each line skimmed at 1s, 10s to identify impt lines, avg re-skim 10x, etc)
    
    Unlike speedruns that use the same action, these speedruns must take uncertainty estimates of ‘new solns’ into account
    
    Try to beat previous AVERAGES of times (b/c it won’t be exactly the same, so not directly comparable)

Agent outputs long explanation of solution, but also has another output that is personality description of output “here you go”. May be two agents.

A system where you pay people to verify their surroundings. Each person is measurement tool but can falsify their data. Requires lots of checking by AI but human still is data collector. Pay circulates higher based on truth. 

Carbon dating like detective work and thoughts reconstruct AI deepfakes video to say it was reasoned about by a nn to tell if it correctly classifies video as deepfakes or not?

<p>Finding The Fundamental Theorem of Linear Algebra - unsupervised
    articles:
        GANspace (PCA)
        Eigenfaces, [when going down]
        A closed formâ€¦ (eigenanalysis) [when going back up]
    1. Unravel- GANspace -&gt; PCA -&gt; Eigenvectors -&gt; SVD 
        along the way, find new mysterious articles whose mysteries will be revealed as we reconstruct back up
    2. why multiply by cov matrix: cov face_cat face_rat 
    3. cov matrix eigendcomp MM meaning: eigenvalues of this (spine length combo). Still preserves it.
    4. SVD (deeper in to the dream, going back up)
        Fundamental Theorem of Linear Algebra , 4 subspaces
    5. Ravel- meaning in terms of neurons, back to GANspace/etc
        SVD [for rectangular] -&gt; eigen analysis + lagrange -&gt; 
        PCA, Autoencoders</p>
